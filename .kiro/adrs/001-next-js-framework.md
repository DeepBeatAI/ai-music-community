# ADR-001: Next.js Framework Selection

## Status
**Accepted** - September 2025

## Context
Need to select a frontend framework for the AI Music Community Platform that supports:
- Server-side rendering for SEO and performance
- TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- Component-based architecture for maintainability
- API routes for backend functionality
- Static site generation capabilities for marketing pages

## Decision
**Selected: Next.js 15 with App Router**

### Alternatives Considered
1. **React + Express**: More flexibility but requires separate backend setup
2. **Vue.js + Nuxt**: Good developer experience but smaller ecosystem
3. **Svelte + SvelteKit**: Excellent performance but limited community
4. **Vanilla React**: Maximum flexibility but lacks built-in optimizations

## Rationale
- **Developer Efficiency**: Single framework handles both frontend and API routes
- **Performance**: Built-in optimizations (Image optimization, automatic code splitting)
- **SEO**: Server-side rendering crucial for music discovery and sharing
- **Community**: Largest React ecosystem with extensive documentation
- **Deployment**: Seamless Vercel integration for solo developer workflow
- **Scalability**: Can handle growth from MVP to enterprise-scale application

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Rapid development with built-in optimizations
- ✅ Excellent TypeScript support and developer experience
- ✅ Automatic performance optimizations (images, fonts, etc.)
- ✅ Strong community support and ecosystem
- ✅ Seamless deployment to Vercel
- ✅ Built-in API routes eliminate need for separate backend

### Negative
- ❌ Framework lock-in (migration would be significant effort)
- ❌ Bundle size can be larger than alternatives like Svelte
- ❌ Learning curve for App Router (newer paradigm)
- ❌ Some advanced optimizations require Vercel-specific features

### Technical Implications
- Must use React patterns and lifecycle methods
- Component architecture requires careful state management planning
- API routes must be designed with Next.js limitations in mind
- Static generation strategy affects content delivery approach

### Business Implications
- Faster time to market due to framework efficiencies
- Lower maintenance burden for solo developer
- Strong foundation for team growth and scaling
- Excellent SEO capabilities support organic growth strategy
