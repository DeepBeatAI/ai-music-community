# ADR-003: Audio Processing Strategy

## Status
**Accepted** - September 2025

## Context
Need audio processing solution for AI Music Community Platform that supports:
- Multiple audio format support (MP3, WAV, FLAC)
- Audio compression and optimization for storage efficiency
- Waveform visualization generation
- Audio metadata extraction
- Volume normalization across tracks
- Future advanced processing capabilities (mastering, filtering)

## Decision
**Selected: Client-side processing with Wavesurfer.js + Server-side FFmpeg integration**

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Pure Client-side (Web Audio API)**: Limited processing capabilities
2. **Cloud Audio Services (AWS Transcoder)**: Expensive and overkill for current needs
3. **Third-party APIs (Cloudinary)**: Good but adds external dependency
4. **Pure Server-side Processing**: Higher server costs and complexity

## Rationale
- **Hybrid Approach**: Client handles visualization, server handles heavy processing
- **Cost Efficiency**: Minimize server processing time and costs
- **User Experience**: Real-time waveform visualization enhances engagement
- **Flexibility**: Can add advanced features progressively
- **Control**: Full control over processing pipeline and quality
- **Scalability**: Can optimize processing based on usage patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Client-side Components
```typescript
// Wavesurfer.js for visualization and playback
interface AudioVisualization {
  waveform: number[]
  peaks: number[]
  duration: number
  sampleRate: number
}

// Web Audio API for basic processing
interface ClientAudioProcessor {
  generateWaveform(audioBuffer: ArrayBuffer): Promise<AudioVisualization>
  normalizeVolume(audioBuffer: ArrayBuffer): Promise<ArrayBuffer>
  extractMetadata(file: File): Promise<AudioMetadata>
}
```

### Server-side Processing
```typescript
// FFmpeg integration for compression and conversion
interface ServerAudioProcessor {
  compress(inputUrl: string, options: CompressionOptions): Promise<string>
  convert(inputUrl: string, targetFormat: AudioFormat): Promise<string>
  extractMetadata(inputUrl: string): Promise<CompleteAudioMetadata>
  normalize(inputUrl: string): Promise<string>
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Real-time waveform visualization enhances user experience
- ✅ Efficient storage through server-side compression
- ✅ Reduced server processing costs through client-side optimization
- ✅ Full control over audio quality and processing pipeline
- ✅ Progressive enhancement capability for advanced features
- ✅ Strong foundation for future AI-powered audio features

### Negative
- ❌ Complex integration between client and server processing
- ❌ Browser compatibility considerations for Web Audio API
- ❌ FFmpeg requires server resources and maintenance
- ❌ Multiple processing steps can introduce failure points
- ❌ Client-side processing limited by device capabilities

### Technical Implications
- Must handle both client and server audio processing workflows
- Error handling required across multiple processing stages
- Browser compatibility testing essential for audio features
- Server scaling considerations for FFmpeg processing
- Storage strategy must accommodate original and processed files

### Business Implications
- Enhanced user experience supports user retention and engagement
- Efficient storage strategy controls operational costs
- Professional audio quality supports creator satisfaction
- Foundation for advanced features enables future monetization
- Technical complexity requires careful testing and monitoring

### Performance Considerations
- Client-side waveform generation targets < 3 seconds for typical tracks
- Server-side compression aims for 60-80% size reduction
- Audio streaming buffer time target < 2 seconds
- Concurrent processing capacity planning for user growth
- Mobile device performance optimization essential

### Audio Quality Standards
- Maintain audio quality during compression (minimum 128kbps MP3)
- Volume normalization to -14 LUFS for consistent playback
- Support for high-quality formats (up to 24-bit/96kHz for uploads)
- Lossless processing chain until final compression step
- Quality metrics tracking and optimization
