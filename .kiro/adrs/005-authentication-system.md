# ADR-005: Authentication System

## Status
**Accepted** - September 2025

## Context
Need authentication system for AI Music Community Platform that provides:
- Secure user registration and login functionality
- Social login options for improved user experience
- Row Level Security integration for multi-tenant data protection
- Password reset and account recovery capabilities
- Session management and JWT token handling
- GDPR compliance for user data protection
- Scalable architecture for future team and enterprise features

## Decision
**Selected: Supabase Auth with Email/Password + Social Login Integration**

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Auth0**: Industry leader but expensive for small scale, complex integration
2. **Firebase Auth**: Good Google integration but vendor lock-in concerns
3. **NextAuth.js**: Open source flexibility but requires more custom implementation
4. **Custom JWT Implementation**: Maximum control but high security risk and development time
5. **AWS Cognito**: Powerful but complex setup and management overhead

## Rationale
- **Integrated Platform**: Seamless integration with Supabase database and RLS
- **Security Best Practices**: Professionally managed security and compliance
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent TypeScript integration and documentation
- **Social Login Support**: Built-in providers for Google, GitHub, Discord
- **Row Level Security**: Native integration enables database-level security
- **Cost Efficiency**: Generous free tier with predictable scaling costs
- **Compliance Ready**: GDPR, SOC2, and other compliance certifications

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Authentication architecture
interface AuthenticationFlow {
  registration: {
    email: 'Email/password with email verification'
    social: 'Google, GitHub, Discord OAuth providers'
    profile: 'Automatic user profile creation in database'
  }
  
  session: {
    tokens: 'JWT access and refresh token management'
    persistence: 'Secure session storage and automatic renewal'
    middleware: 'Next.js middleware for route protection'
  }
  
  security: {
    rls: 'Row Level Security policies for data isolation'
    mfa: 'Optional two-factor authentication (future)'
    audit: 'Authentication event logging and monitoring'
  }
}
```

### Database Integration
```sql
-- User profile creation trigger
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.user_profiles (id, username, display_name, created_at)
  VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.email, NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'display_name', NOW());
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Trigger on user creation
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE public.handle_new_user();
```

### Row Level Security Policies
```sql
-- User profiles RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON user_profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON user_profiles
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Public can view profiles" ON user_profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Posts RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can create own posts" ON posts
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own posts" ON posts
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Professional-grade security without custom implementation
- ✅ Seamless integration with Supabase database and RLS
- ✅ Built-in social login providers reduce registration friction
- ✅ Automatic JWT token management and session handling
- ✅ Email verification and password reset flows included
- ✅ GDPR compliance and data protection built-in
- ✅ Real-time user session management and presence

### Negative
- ❌ Limited customization of authentication UI and flows
- ❌ Platform lock-in with Supabase-specific features
- ❌ Social login providers limited to Supabase-supported options
- ❌ Advanced enterprise features require higher-tier plans
- ❌ Custom authentication logic requires workarounds

### Technical Implications
- Authentication state management integrated with React components
- Row Level Security policies must be carefully designed and tested
- Social login requires proper OAuth app configuration
- Session management handled automatically by Supabase client
- User data structure must align with Supabase Auth user object

### Business Implications
- Reduced development time allows focus on core features
- Professional security implementation builds user trust
- Social login options improve user conversion rates
- Compliance readiness supports international expansion
- Predictable authentication costs enable financial planning

### Security Considerations
```typescript
// Security implementation details
interface SecurityMeasures {
  encryption: 'AES-256 encryption for sensitive data'
  tokens: 'Short-lived JWT tokens with automatic refresh'
  rateLimit: 'Built-in rate limiting for authentication endpoints'
  audit: 'Comprehensive audit logging for security events'
  compliance: 'GDPR, SOC2, and ISO27001 compliance'
}
```

### User Experience Design
```typescript
// Authentication UX patterns
interface AuthenticationUX {
  registration: {
    emailVerification: 'Required email verification for security'
    profileCompletion: 'Guided profile setup after registration'
    socialOptions: 'Prominent social login buttons for convenience'
  }
  
  login: {
    persistentSession: 'Remember user preference with secure storage'
    passwordReset: 'Simple one-click password reset via email'
    errorHandling: 'Clear, user-friendly error messages'
  }
  
  profile: {
    accountSettings: 'Comprehensive account management interface'
    privacyControls: 'Granular privacy and visibility settings'
    dataExport: 'GDPR-compliant data export functionality'
  }
}
```

### Integration with Social Features
- User authentication required for all social interactions
- Profile creation automatically enables social features
- Follow/unfollow actions protected by authentication
- Comment and like systems integrated with user identity
- Real-time notifications tied to authenticated user sessions

### Monitoring and Analytics
```typescript
// Authentication monitoring
interface AuthMonitoring {
  metrics: {
    registrationRate: 'Daily new user registrations'
    loginSuccess: 'Successful login rate and patterns'
    socialLoginUsage: 'Social provider preference tracking'
    sessionDuration: 'Average user session length'
  }
  
  security: {
    failedLogins: 'Failed login attempt monitoring'
    suspiciousActivity: 'Unusual login pattern detection'
    tokenExpiry: 'Token refresh and expiry tracking'
    deviceTracking: 'User device and location monitoring'
  }
}
```

### Future Enhancements
- Two-factor authentication for enhanced security
- Enterprise SSO integration for business customers
- Advanced user role and permission system
- Custom authentication provider integration
- Biometric authentication for mobile applications
