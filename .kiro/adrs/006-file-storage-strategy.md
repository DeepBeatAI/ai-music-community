# ADR-006: File Storage Strategy

## Status
**Accepted** - September 2025

## Context
Need file storage solution for AI Music Community Platform that handles:
- Audio file storage (MP3, WAV, FLAC) with large file sizes (up to 50MB)
- User avatar and profile image storage
- Global CDN distribution for fast worldwide access
- Secure access controls with user-based permissions
- Cost-effective storage with automatic compression
- Integration with existing Supabase infrastructure
- Backup and disaster recovery capabilities

## Decision
**Selected: Supabase Storage with CDN + Compression Pipeline**

### Alternatives Considered
1. **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Industry standard but complex integration and higher costs
2. **Google Cloud Storage**: Good performance but separate platform integration
3. **Cloudinary**: Excellent media optimization but expensive for audio files
4. **DigitalOcean Spaces**: Cost-effective but limited audio processing features
5. **Self-hosted MinIO**: Maximum control but high operational overhead

## Rationale
- **Platform Integration**: Seamless integration with Supabase database and auth
- **Row Level Security**: Storage access controls integrated with user authentication
- **CDN Performance**: Global edge distribution for fast file access worldwide
- **Cost Efficiency**: Competitive pricing with predictable scaling costs
- **Developer Experience**: Simple API integration with existing codebase
- **Security**: Built-in access controls and secure file serving
- **Backup**: Automatic backup and disaster recovery included

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Architecture
```typescript
// Storage bucket structure
interface StorageBuckets {
  audio: {
    path: 'audio/[user_id]/[post_id]/[filename]'
    maxSize: '50MB per file'
    allowedTypes: ['audio/mpeg', 'audio/wav', 'audio/flac']
    publicAccess: true
    rls: 'Read access for all, write access for file owner'
  }
  
  avatars: {
    path: 'avatars/[user_id]/[filename]'
    maxSize: '5MB per file'
    allowedTypes: ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp']
    publicAccess: true
    rls: 'Read access for all, write access for user'
  }
  
  private: {
    path: 'private/[user_id]/[filename]'
    maxSize: '100MB per file'
    allowedTypes: ['*/*']
    publicAccess: false
    rls: 'Full access only for file owner'
  }
}
```

### Security Policies
```sql
-- Audio files bucket policies
CREATE POLICY "Audio files are publicly accessible" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'audio');

CREATE POLICY "Users can upload audio files" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'audio' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own audio files" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    bucket_id = 'audio' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Avatar bucket policies
CREATE POLICY "Avatars are publicly accessible" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

CREATE POLICY "Users can upload avatars" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );
```

### File Processing Pipeline
```typescript
// File upload and processing workflow
interface FileProcessingPipeline {
  upload: {
    validation: 'File type, size, and security validation'
    virus_scan: 'Malware and virus scanning (future enhancement)'
    metadata: 'Extract and store file metadata'
    thumbnail: 'Generate audio waveform or image thumbnail'
  }
  
  storage: {
    original: 'Store original file for quality preservation'
    compressed: 'Generate compressed versions for streaming'
    backup: 'Automatic backup to separate storage region'
    cdn: 'Distribute to global CDN edge locations'
  }
  
  access: {
    public_url: 'Generate public CDN URLs for file access'
    signed_url: 'Create temporary signed URLs for private files'
    streaming: 'Optimize for audio streaming and progressive download'
    caching: 'Implement intelligent caching strategies'
  }
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing Supabase authentication and database
- ✅ Row Level Security provides fine-grained access control
- ✅ Global CDN ensures fast file access worldwide
- ✅ Automatic backup and disaster recovery included
- ✅ Simple API integration reduces development complexity
- ✅ Cost-effective storage with transparent pricing
- ✅ Built-in file transformation and optimization capabilities

### Negative
- ❌ Platform lock-in with Supabase-specific storage features
- ❌ Limited advanced media processing compared to specialized services
- ❌ Storage costs can scale quickly with high-volume audio content
- ❌ Less mature than AWS S3 for enterprise-scale requirements
- ❌ Limited customization of CDN behavior and caching rules

### Technical Implications
- File upload logic must integrate with Supabase Storage API
- Audio processing pipeline requires coordination between storage and processing
- CDN configuration affects global performance and caching behavior
- Backup strategy depends on Supabase infrastructure reliability
- File URL generation must account for public vs. private access patterns

### Business Implications
- Reduced infrastructure complexity enables faster development
- Predictable storage costs aid in financial planning and pricing
- Global CDN supports international user expansion
- Professional file handling builds user trust and platform reliability
- Storage optimization directly impacts user experience and retention

### Performance Considerations
```typescript
// Performance optimization strategies
interface PerformanceOptimization {
  compression: {
    audio: 'Automatic audio compression (60-80% size reduction)'
    images: 'WebP conversion and progressive loading'
    caching: 'Intelligent CDN caching with cache-control headers'
  }
  
  delivery: {
    cdn: 'Global edge distribution for sub-100ms access times'
    streaming: 'Progressive download for large audio files'
    preloading: 'Smart preloading of frequently accessed content'
  }
  
  monitoring: {
    usage: 'Storage usage and cost monitoring'
    performance: 'File access time and CDN performance tracking'
    errors: 'Upload failure and access error monitoring'
  }
}
```

### Storage Cost Management
```typescript
// Cost optimization strategies
interface CostManagement {
  compression: 'Aggressive compression reduces storage costs'
  lifecycle: 'Automatic deletion of temporary and expired files'
  monitoring: 'Real-time cost tracking and usage alerts'
  optimization: 'Regular analysis and cleanup of unused files'
  
  pricing_tiers: {
    storage: '$0.021/GB/month for standard storage'
    bandwidth: '$0.09/GB for CDN bandwidth'
    requests: '$0.0004/1000 requests for API calls'
  }
}
```

### Security and Compliance
```typescript
// Security implementation
interface SecurityMeasures {
  access_control: 'Row Level Security for user-based file access'
  encryption: 'AES-256 encryption at rest and in transit'
  virus_scanning: 'Malware detection for uploaded files'
  audit_logging: 'Comprehensive access and modification logging'
  
  compliance: {
    gdpr: 'Right to deletion and data portability'
    copyright: 'DMCA takedown request handling'
    privacy: 'User data protection and access controls'
  }
}
```

### Disaster Recovery and Backup
```typescript
// Backup and recovery strategy
interface DisasterRecovery {
  backup: {
    frequency: 'Automatic daily backups with point-in-time recovery'
    retention: '30-day backup retention for recovery scenarios'
    geographic: 'Cross-region backup replication for disaster recovery'
  }
  
  recovery: {
    rto: 'Recovery Time Objective: 4 hours for critical data'
    rpo: 'Recovery Point Objective: 1 hour data loss maximum'
    testing: 'Monthly disaster recovery testing and validation'
  }
}
```

### Migration Strategy
- Platform-agnostic file organization enables future migration
- Metadata stored in database separate from file storage
- File URLs abstracted through application layer
- Backup strategy provides foundation for platform migration
- Progressive migration capability for zero-downtime transitions

### Future Enhancements
