Integration testing for API endpoints and database operations  \n3. End-to-end testing for user workflows\n4. Performance testing for audio processing features\n5. Security testing for authentication and data protection\n6. Mobile responsiveness testing\n7. Cross-browser compatibility validation\n\nFollow the project's testing standards from the methodology guidelines and create specific, actionable testing tasks with clear success criteria. Ensure all testing aligns with the 4-hour weekly development constraint and includes proper Git workflow integration."
