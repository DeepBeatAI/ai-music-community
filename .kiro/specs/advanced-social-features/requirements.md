# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature set enhances the AI Music Community Platform with advanced social engagement capabilities, performance optimizations, and analytics insights. The implementation focuses on three core areas: a threaded comments system for deeper user engagement, database and query optimizations for improved performance, and a basic analytics dashboard for tracking platform metrics.

These features are critical for transforming the platform from a content-sharing site into a true community where users can have meaningful discussions, while ensuring the platform remains performant as it scales.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comments System

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to comment on posts and reply to other comments, so that I can engage in discussions with the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a post THEN the system SHALL display all comments associated with that post in chronological order
2. WHEN an authenticated user clicks "Add Comment" THEN the system SHALL provide a text input field with a 1000 character limit
3. WHEN an authenticated user submits a comment THEN the system SHALL save the comment to the database and display it immediately using optimistic UI updates
4. WHEN a user views a comment THEN the system SHALL display the comment content, author username, author avatar, and timestamp
5. WHEN an authenticated user views their own comment THEN the system SHALL display a delete button
6. WHEN a user clicks "Reply" on a comment THEN the system SHALL provide a reply input field nested under that comment
7. WHEN a user submits a reply THEN the system SHALL save it as a nested comment with a parent_comment_id reference
8. WHEN nested replies exist THEN the system SHALL display them in a threaded/indented format up to 3 levels deep
9. WHEN a user deletes a comment THEN the system SHALL remove it from the database and update the UI optimistically
10. WHEN a new comment is added by another user THEN the system SHALL update the comments list in real-time using Supabase Realtime
11. WHEN a post has comments THEN the system SHALL display an accurate comment count
12. IF a comment has more than 10 replies THEN the system SHALL implement pagination with "Load more replies" functionality

### Requirement 2: Database Security and Performance

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want proper database security policies and performance optimizations, so that the platform remains secure and fast as it scales.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the comments table is created THEN the system SHALL enable Row Level Security (RLS)
2. WHEN any user queries comments THEN the system SHALL allow SELECT operations for all users
3. WHEN an authenticated user creates a comment THEN the system SHALL only allow INSERT if the user_id matches the authenticated user
4. WHEN a user attempts to update a comment THEN the system SHALL only allow UPDATE if they own the comment
5. WHEN a user attempts to delete a comment THEN the system SHALL only allow DELETE if they own the comment
6. WHEN a comment is deleted THEN the system SHALL cascade delete all nested replies
7. WHEN querying posts by creation date THEN the system SHALL use an index on posts(created_at DESC)
8. WHEN querying comments for a post THEN the system SHALL use an index on comments(post_id)
9. WHEN querying user statistics THEN the system SHALL use an index on user_stats(followers_count DESC)
10. WHEN querying unread notifications THEN the system SHALL use a partial index on notifications(user_id, read) WHERE read = false
11. WHEN frequently accessed data is queried THEN the system SHALL implement caching to reduce database load
12. WHEN cached data becomes stale THEN the system SHALL invalidate the cache and fetch fresh data

### Requirement 3: Analytics Dashboard

**User Story:** As a platform creator or administrator, I want to view platform analytics, so that I can understand user engagement and platform growth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user navigates to /analytics THEN the system SHALL display the analytics dashboard
2. WHEN the analytics dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display the total number of registered users
3. WHEN the analytics dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display the total number of posts created
4. WHEN the analytics dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display the total number of comments created
5. WHEN the analytics dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display a chart showing user activity over time
6. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access /analytics THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
7. WHEN the dashboard queries metrics THEN the system SHALL use optimized queries with proper indexes
8. WHEN the dashboard displays on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL render responsively
9. IF the performance_analytics table exists THEN the system SHALL use it for historical data
10. WHEN metrics are displayed THEN the system SHALL show accurate, real-time counts

### Requirement 4: Type Safety and Code Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript types and code quality standards, so that the codebase remains maintainable and error-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comment-related code is written THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript interfaces for all comment data structures
2. WHEN components use comment data THEN the system SHALL enforce type checking at compile time
3. WHEN the codebase is built THEN the system SHALL pass TypeScript strict mode checks with no errors
4. WHEN complex logic is implemented THEN the system SHALL include inline code comments explaining the approach
5. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL update project documentation accordingly
6. WHEN database queries are written THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling
7. WHEN user input is processed THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate the input
8. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL follow existing naming conventions and patterns

### Requirement 5: Mobile Responsiveness and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the comments system and analytics to work seamlessly on my device, so that I can engage with the platform anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views comments on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL display them in a readable, touch-friendly format
2. WHEN a user interacts with comment buttons on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide touch targets of at least 44px
3. WHEN nested comments are displayed on mobile THEN the system SHALL use appropriate indentation that doesn't overflow the screen
4. WHEN the analytics dashboard is viewed on mobile THEN the system SHALL render charts and metrics responsively
5. WHEN a user navigates the comments section THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels for screen readers
6. WHEN a user uses keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support tab navigation through comments and reply buttons
7. WHEN loading states occur THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to the user
8. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 6: Real-time Updates and Optimistic UI

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want immediate feedback when I interact with comments, so that the experience feels fast and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a comment THEN the system SHALL display it immediately before the server confirms (optimistic UI)
2. IF the server rejects a comment creation THEN the system SHALL remove the optimistic comment and display an error
3. WHEN a user deletes a comment THEN the system SHALL remove it from the UI immediately
4. IF the server rejects a comment deletion THEN the system SHALL restore the comment and display an error
5. WHEN another user adds a comment to the same post THEN the system SHALL update the comments list in real-time via Supabase Realtime
6. WHEN the comment count changes THEN the system SHALL update the displayed count in real-time
7. WHEN real-time updates fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and allow manual refresh
8. WHEN multiple users are viewing the same post THEN the system SHALL synchronize comment updates across all sessions
