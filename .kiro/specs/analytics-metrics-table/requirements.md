# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a dedicated analytics metrics table to accurately track platform activity over time, independent of data deletions. The current analytics system queries live data from `posts` and `comments` tables, which means historical metrics become inaccurate when content is deleted. This new system will maintain immutable daily snapshots of key metrics, ensuring historical accuracy and enabling future expansion of analytics capabilities.

The solution addresses the fundamental problem that when posts or comments are deleted (hard delete with CASCADE), the analytics dashboard shows incorrect historical data because it counts only what currently exists in the database. By creating a separate analytics table that captures daily metrics snapshots, we preserve historical accuracy while maintaining the ability to delete content from operational tables.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Daily Metrics Snapshot System

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want daily snapshots of key metrics automatically captured, so that historical analytics remain accurate even when content is deleted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs its daily aggregation THEN it SHALL create a new record in the `daily_metrics` table with counts for that day
2. WHEN a post or comment is deleted THEN the historical daily metrics SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN querying analytics for a past date THEN the system SHALL return the snapshot data from that date, not recalculated counts
4. IF the daily aggregation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry on the next scheduled run
5. WHEN viewing the activity chart THEN it SHALL display data from daily snapshots, not live table counts

### Requirement 2: Extensible Metrics Schema

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want the analytics system designed to easily accommodate new metrics, so that future analytics features can be added without major database restructuring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new metric types are needed THEN they SHALL be added to the schema without breaking existing queries
2. WHEN the metrics table is queried THEN it SHALL support filtering by metric type, date range, and aggregation level
3. IF a new metric category is introduced THEN the existing data structure SHALL remain compatible
4. WHEN storing metrics THEN the system SHALL use a flexible schema that supports both scalar values and complex data structures
5. WHEN aggregating metrics THEN the system SHALL support multiple time granularities (daily, weekly, monthly)

### Requirement 3: Automated Metric Collection

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want metrics automatically collected without manual intervention, so that analytics data is always current and complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scheduled time arrives THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger metric collection
2. WHEN collecting metrics THEN the system SHALL aggregate data from all relevant source tables
3. IF a collection run is missed THEN the system SHALL backfill the missing data on the next run
4. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL include metadata about the collection process (timestamp, source counts, processing time)
5. WHEN an error occurs during collection THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and alert administrators

### Requirement 4: Historical Data Integrity

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want historical metrics to be immutable once recorded, so that analytics reports remain consistent and trustworthy over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a daily metric is recorded THEN it SHALL NOT be modified by subsequent operations
2. WHEN content is deleted from operational tables THEN the corresponding metrics snapshots SHALL remain unchanged
3. IF a metric calculation error is discovered THEN corrections SHALL be documented and applied as new records, not updates
4. WHEN querying historical data THEN the system SHALL return the original recorded values
5. WHEN displaying trends THEN the system SHALL use immutable snapshot data to ensure consistency

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the analytics dashboard to load quickly, so that I can access insights without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the analytics dashboard THEN the page SHALL load in under 2 seconds
2. WHEN querying 30 days of activity data THEN the database query SHALL complete in under 100ms
3. IF the metrics table grows large THEN query performance SHALL remain consistent through proper indexing
4. WHEN aggregating metrics THEN the system SHALL use efficient queries that minimize database load
5. WHEN multiple users access analytics THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests without performance degradation

### Requirement 6: Metric Type Flexibility

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to track different types of metrics (counts, averages, percentages, custom calculations), so that analytics can provide comprehensive insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing a metric THEN the system SHALL support integer counts, decimal values, and JSON data structures
2. WHEN defining a new metric type THEN it SHALL include metadata describing the metric (name, description, unit, calculation method)
3. IF a metric requires complex calculation THEN the system SHALL store both raw values and calculated results
4. WHEN querying metrics THEN the system SHALL return data in a format appropriate for the metric type
5. WHEN displaying metrics THEN the UI SHALL format values according to their type (e.g., percentages with %, counts with commas)

### Requirement 7: Data Retention and Archival

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want control over how long metrics are retained, so that storage costs remain manageable while preserving important historical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metrics reach a defined age THEN the system SHALL support archival to cold storage
2. WHEN querying recent data (< 90 days) THEN it SHALL be retrieved from the primary metrics table
3. IF archived data is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to retrieve it
4. WHEN configuring retention THEN administrators SHALL be able to set different retention periods for different metric types
5. WHEN archiving data THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and queryability

### Requirement 8: Migration and Backfill Support

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to backfill historical metrics from existing data, so that the analytics system has complete historical context from day one.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analytics table is first created THEN the system SHALL provide a migration script to backfill historical data
2. WHEN backfilling data THEN the system SHALL process data in batches to avoid overwhelming the database
3. IF backfill data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which dates have partial or missing data
4. WHEN backfilling THEN the system SHALL use the same aggregation logic as daily collection
5. WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL validate that backfilled data matches expected patterns

### Requirement 9: API and Query Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean API for querying metrics data, so that building analytics features is straightforward and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying metrics THEN the API SHALL support filtering by date range, metric type, and aggregation level
2. WHEN requesting data THEN the API SHALL return results in a consistent, well-documented format
3. IF invalid parameters are provided THEN the API SHALL return clear error messages
4. WHEN aggregating data THEN the API SHALL support common operations (sum, average, min, max, percentiles)
5. WHEN building new analytics features THEN developers SHALL be able to query metrics without writing complex SQL

### Requirement 10: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want visibility into the metrics collection process, so that I can ensure data quality and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL log collection start time, end time, and record counts
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information including stack traces
3. IF collection takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators
4. WHEN viewing system health THEN administrators SHALL see the status of the most recent collection run
5. WHEN troubleshooting THEN administrators SHALL have access to collection history and error logs
