# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the code quality issues identified in the comprehensive ESLint analysis of the AI Music Community Platform. The goal is to systematically improve type safety, eliminate code quality warnings, fix critical React patterns violations, and establish a maintainable codebase that follows TypeScript and React best practices. This work addresses 9,387 ESLint issues (945 errors, 8,442 warnings) across the codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Critical React Hooks Violations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React hooks to be called unconditionally, so that the application follows React rules and prevents runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React hooks are used THEN they SHALL be called unconditionally at the top level of components
2. WHEN the FollowButton component renders THEN hooks SHALL NOT be called conditionally
3. WHEN components use hooks THEN they SHALL follow the Rules of Hooks without exceptions
4. IF conditional logic is needed THEN it SHALL be implemented after hook calls
5. WHEN the application runs THEN no React hooks violations SHALL cause runtime errors

### Requirement 2: Fix Unescaped JSX Entities

**User Story:** As a developer, I want JSX to render correctly without warnings, so that special characters display properly and the code follows JSX standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSX contains special characters THEN they SHALL be properly escaped or use HTML entities
2. WHEN the Login page renders THEN no unescaped entity warnings SHALL appear
3. WHEN the Signup page renders THEN no unescaped entity warnings SHALL appear
4. WHEN the Dashboard renders THEN no unescaped entity warnings SHALL appear
5. IF apostrophes or quotes are needed THEN they SHALL use proper JSX escape sequences or HTML entities

### Requirement 3: Eliminate `any` Types in Core Components

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript types throughout the codebase, so that type safety catches bugs at compile time and improves code maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are defined THEN they SHALL use explicit TypeScript interfaces for props
2. WHEN utility functions are created THEN they SHALL have explicit parameter and return types
3. WHEN API responses are handled THEN they SHALL use typed interfaces instead of `any`
4. WHEN event handlers are defined THEN they SHALL use proper React event types
5. IF a type is complex THEN it SHALL be defined in a separate interface or type definition
6. WHEN the codebase is analyzed THEN `any` types SHALL be reduced by at least 80% in production code

### Requirement 4: Fix React Hooks Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want useEffect and useCallback hooks to have correct dependencies, so that components update properly and avoid stale closure bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN useEffect is used THEN its dependency array SHALL include all referenced variables
2. WHEN useCallback is used THEN its dependency array SHALL include all referenced variables
3. WHEN useMemo is used THEN its dependency array SHALL include all referenced variables
4. IF a dependency is intentionally omitted THEN it SHALL be documented with an eslint-disable comment and explanation
5. WHEN hooks are updated THEN the ESLint exhaustive-deps rule SHALL pass without warnings

### Requirement 5: Remove Unused Variables and Imports

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean codebase without unused code, so that the bundle size is optimized and the code is easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are analyzed THEN they SHALL NOT contain unused imports
2. WHEN variables are declared THEN they SHALL be used in the code
3. WHEN functions are defined THEN they SHALL be called or exported
4. IF code is temporarily unused THEN it SHALL be removed or commented with a clear reason
5. WHEN the production build runs THEN unused code SHALL NOT be included in the bundle
6. WHEN ESLint runs THEN unused variable warnings SHALL be reduced by at least 90% in production code

### Requirement 6: Standardize Error Handling Patterns

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling throughout the application, so that errors are caught, logged, and displayed to users in a predictable way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN async operations fail THEN errors SHALL be caught and handled appropriately
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN error messages SHALL be user-friendly and actionable
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
4. IF an error is critical THEN it SHALL be caught by an error boundary
5. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL follow a consistent pattern across the codebase

### Requirement 7: Clean Up Test Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test files to follow the same quality standards as production code, so that tests are maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test files are written THEN they SHALL use proper TypeScript types
2. WHEN test utilities are created THEN they SHALL not contain unused code
3. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL not generate ESLint warnings
4. IF test-specific patterns are needed THEN they SHALL be documented and justified
5. WHEN the test suite runs THEN it SHALL provide clear, actionable feedback

### Requirement 8: Establish Code Quality Gates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated checks to prevent code quality regressions, so that the codebase maintains high standards over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN ESLint SHALL run automatically
2. WHEN ESLint finds critical errors THEN the commit SHALL be blocked
3. WHEN TypeScript compilation fails THEN the build SHALL fail
4. IF warnings exceed a threshold THEN developers SHALL be notified
5. WHEN pull requests are created THEN code quality checks SHALL run automatically

### Requirement 9: Document Code Quality Standards

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of code quality standards, so that all contributors follow consistent practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new code is written THEN developers SHALL have access to style guide documentation
2. WHEN TypeScript is used THEN type safety guidelines SHALL be documented
3. WHEN React components are created THEN component patterns SHALL be documented
4. IF exceptions to rules are needed THEN they SHALL be documented with justification
5. WHEN the project is onboarded THEN code quality standards SHALL be clearly communicated
