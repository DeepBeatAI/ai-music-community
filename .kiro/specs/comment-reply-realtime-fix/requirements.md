# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses a critical bug in the comment system where nested replies (replies to comments) do not appear immediately after posting. While top-level comments appear instantly due to optimistic UI updates, nested replies require a page refresh to become visible. This creates an inconsistent and frustrating user experience that undermines the real-time nature of the platform's social features.

The issue stems from the real-time subscription handler not properly integrating nested replies into the existing comment tree structure when updates are received from other users or when the optimistic update needs to be replaced with server data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Immediate Reply Visibility

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to see my replies to comments appear immediately after posting, so that I can continue engaging in the conversation without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a reply to a comment THEN the system SHALL display the reply immediately in the UI without requiring a page refresh
2. WHEN a reply is posted THEN the system SHALL show the reply nested under the correct parent comment at the appropriate depth level
3. WHEN the reply is being saved to the database THEN the system SHALL show a temporary optimistic version with a loading indicator if needed
4. WHEN the database save completes successfully THEN the system SHALL replace the optimistic reply with the confirmed server data seamlessly
5. WHEN the database save fails THEN the system SHALL remove the optimistic reply and display an error message to the user
6. WHEN multiple users are viewing the same post THEN all users SHALL see new replies appear in real-time without manual refresh

### Requirement 2: Real-Time Reply Synchronization

**User Story:** As a platform user viewing a post, I want to see replies posted by other users appear automatically, so that I can follow conversations as they happen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN another user posts a reply to a comment THEN the system SHALL receive the update via Supabase Realtime subscription
2. WHEN a real-time reply update is received THEN the system SHALL fetch the complete reply data including user profile information
3. WHEN integrating a real-time reply THEN the system SHALL locate the correct parent comment in the nested comment tree structure
4. WHEN adding a real-time reply to the tree THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing nested replies and maintain proper depth tracking
5. WHEN a reply is added via real-time THEN the system SHALL update the parent comment's reply count accurately
6. WHEN the real-time subscription fails or is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and allow manual refresh to load new replies

### Requirement 3: Optimistic Update Replacement

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want my posted replies to transition smoothly from temporary to confirmed state, so that I have confidence my content was saved successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user posts a reply THEN the system SHALL immediately add an optimistic version with a temporary ID to the UI
2. WHEN the server responds with the saved reply data THEN the system SHALL locate the optimistic reply in the nested comment tree
3. WHEN replacing an optimistic reply THEN the system SHALL recursively search through all nested levels to find the temporary comment
4. WHEN the optimistic reply is found THEN the system SHALL replace it with the server data while maintaining its position in the tree
5. WHEN the replacement is complete THEN the system SHALL update the reply with the permanent ID and server timestamp
6. WHEN the optimistic reply cannot be found THEN the system SHALL log an error but not crash the application

### Requirement 4: Comment Tree Integrity

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the comment thread structure to remain consistent and accurate, so that I can follow conversation flows easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replies are added or updated THEN the system SHALL maintain the correct parent-child relationships in the comment tree
2. WHEN a reply is added at any nesting level THEN the system SHALL preserve all sibling replies and their nested children
3. WHEN updating the comment tree THEN the system SHALL respect the maximum depth limit of 3 levels
4. WHEN a parent comment is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove all nested replies through cascade delete
5. WHEN reply counts are updated THEN the system SHALL accurately reflect the number of direct replies for each comment
6. WHEN the comment tree is modified THEN the system SHALL invalidate the query cache to ensure fresh data on next fetch

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want clear feedback when posting replies, so that I know whether my action succeeded or failed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a reply submission starts THEN the system SHALL disable the submit button and show a loading state
2. WHEN a reply is being saved THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback that the operation is in progress
3. WHEN a reply save fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message explaining what went wrong
4. WHEN a reply save fails THEN the system SHALL restore the reply content in the input field so the user can retry
5. WHEN a real-time update fails to process THEN the system SHALL log the error to the console but not disrupt the user experience
6. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and allow the user to retry when connection is restored

### Requirement 6: Performance and Caching

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the comment system to perform efficiently, so that I can interact with posts without delays or lag.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a reply is posted successfully THEN the system SHALL invalidate the query cache for the post's comments
2. WHEN the cache is invalidated THEN the system SHALL ensure the next fetch retrieves fresh data from the database
3. WHEN processing real-time updates THEN the system SHALL avoid unnecessary re-renders of unaffected comments
4. WHEN updating nested replies THEN the system SHALL use efficient recursive algorithms that don't cause performance degradation
5. WHEN multiple replies are posted in quick succession THEN the system SHALL handle them without race conditions or data loss
6. WHEN the comment tree is large THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive UI performance during updates
