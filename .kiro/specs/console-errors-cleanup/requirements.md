# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses console errors and warnings discovered across the AI Music Community Platform. The goal is to eliminate all problematic console logs, fix underlying issues causing errors, and clean up unnecessary logging to improve application stability and developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Post Likes Query Errors

**User Story:** As a developer, I want post likes queries to execute without errors, so that the application functions reliably and users can see accurate like counts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the /discover/ page loads THEN the post_likes query SHALL NOT return a 400 Bad Request error
2. WHEN the /dashboard/ page loads THEN the post_likes query SHALL NOT return a 406 Not Acceptable error
3. WHEN fetching post likes THEN the query SHALL use correct Supabase syntax with proper select statements
4. WHEN a user views posts THEN like counts SHALL display accurately without console errors
5. IF a query fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and log meaningful error messages

### Requirement 2: Eliminate Legacy Audio Function Warnings

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the recommended audio URL functions, so that the codebase follows best practices and avoids deprecated code paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio URLs are processed THEN the system SHALL use getBestAudioUrl instead of getAudioSignedUrl
2. WHEN the audioCache utility generates signed URLs THEN it SHALL NOT trigger legacy function warnings
3. WHEN audio files are loaded THEN no deprecation warnings SHALL appear in the console
4. IF legacy functions must be called THEN they SHALL be wrapped with proper error handling and logging

### Requirement 3: Resolve Pagination State Validation Warnings

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pagination state transitions to be valid, so that the load more functionality works correctly without warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pagination state changes THEN fetchInProgress and isLoadingMore flags SHALL be synchronized correctly
2. WHEN loading more posts THEN state transition warnings SHALL NOT appear in the console
3. WHEN the load more button is clicked THEN the pagination state SHALL transition through valid states only
4. IF an invalid state transition is detected THEN the system SHALL correct it automatically

### Requirement 4: Clean Up Unnecessary Console Logs

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean console output, so that I can easily identify real issues during development and debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN only essential debug logs SHALL appear in the console
2. WHEN audio caching occurs THEN verbose logging SHALL be reduced to critical information only
3. WHEN filters are applied THEN excessive filter logging SHALL be minimized
4. WHEN in production mode THEN debug console logs SHALL be disabled
5. IF logging is needed THEN it SHALL use appropriate log levels (info, warn, error)

### Requirement 5: Handle Chrome Extension Message Channel Errors

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle browser extension conflicts gracefully, so that my experience is not disrupted by extension-related errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Chrome extension closes a message channel THEN the error SHALL be caught and handled gracefully
2. WHEN async responses are expected THEN the system SHALL implement proper timeout handling
3. WHEN extension errors occur THEN they SHALL NOT propagate to the application console
4. IF message channel errors are unavoidable THEN they SHALL be logged at debug level only

### Requirement 6: Implement Comprehensive Error Boundary

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all console errors to be caught and handled appropriately, so that the application remains stable and provides meaningful feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component throws an error THEN it SHALL be caught by an error boundary
2. WHEN a query fails THEN the error SHALL be logged with context (component, query, parameters)
3. WHEN errors occur THEN users SHALL see friendly error messages instead of broken UI
4. IF errors are critical THEN they SHALL be reported to error tracking (future: Sentry integration)
5. WHEN errors are handled THEN the console SHALL show clear, actionable error messages
