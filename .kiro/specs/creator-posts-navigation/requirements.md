# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhancement adds a "See posts from this creator" button to each creator card in the dashboard search results. When users search for content and see creators in the "Search Results: Creators" section, they should be able to easily navigate to view all posts from a specific creator without having to perform additional searches or navigation steps.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user searching for content, I want to see a "See posts from this creator" button on each creator card in search results, so that I can quickly view all posts from that specific creator.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs a search that returns creator results THEN each creator card in the "Search Results: Creators" section SHALL display a "See posts from this creator" button
2. WHEN a user clicks the "See posts from this creator" button THEN the system SHALL filter the posts to show only posts from that specific creator
3. WHEN posts are filtered by creator THEN the system SHALL display a clear indication that posts are filtered by the selected creator's username
4. WHEN posts are filtered by creator THEN the system SHALL maintain the current search query in the search bar for context

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing creator-filtered posts, I want to easily return to the full search results, so that I can continue exploring other creators and content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN posts are filtered by a specific creator THEN the system SHALL display a "Clear creator filter" or "Show all results" button
2. WHEN a user clicks the clear filter button THEN the system SHALL return to showing all search results matching the original query
3. WHEN the creator filter is cleared THEN the system SHALL restore the previous search state including any applied filters

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the creator post filtering to work seamlessly with existing search and filter functionality, so that I have a consistent and intuitive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a creator filter is applied THEN the system SHALL preserve other active filters (time range, post type, sort order)
2. WHEN a creator filter is active AND the user changes other filters THEN the system SHALL maintain the creator filter while applying the new filters
3. WHEN a creator filter is active THEN the system SHALL update the URL or state to reflect the filtered view for potential bookmarking or sharing
4. WHEN a user navigates away and returns THEN the system SHALL restore the previous filter state if applicable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback about the current filtering state, so that I understand what content I'm viewing and how to modify the view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a creator filter is active THEN the system SHALL display a filter indicator showing "Showing posts by [username]"
2. WHEN a creator filter is active THEN the filtered creator's card in search results SHALL have a visual indicator showing it's currently selected
3. WHEN multiple filters are active including creator filter THEN the system SHALL clearly show all active filters in the UI
4. WHEN no posts are found for the selected creator with current filters THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate "No posts found" message with suggestions to adjust filters
