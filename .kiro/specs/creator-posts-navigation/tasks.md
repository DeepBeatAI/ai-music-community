# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Extend SearchFilters interface and core filtering logic

  - Add `creatorId` and `creatorUsername` fields to SearchFilters interface in search utility
  - Extend `applyFiltersDirectly` function to handle creator filtering by user_id
  - Update filter validation to handle creator filter parameters
  - Run TypeScript compiler to verify no type errors after changes
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 2. Create creator filter button component

  - [x] 2.1 Implement CreatorFilterButton component

    - Create reusable button component with proper TypeScript interfaces
    - Add click handler to trigger creator filtering
    - Include loading and active states for visual feedback
    - Run TypeScript compiler to verify no type errors in component
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.2_

  - [x] 2.2 Integrate button into creator cards in dashboard

    - Add CreatorFilterButton to each creator card in search results section
    - Pass creator ID and username as props to the button component
    - Handle button click to trigger filter application
    - Run TypeScript compiler to verify no type errors after integration
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 3. Implement creator filter state management

  - [x] 3.1 Update dashboard filter handling logic

    - Extend `handleFiltersChange` function to process creator filter
    - Add creator filter logic to existing filter application flow
    - Ensure creator filter works with other active filters (time range, post type, sort)
    - Run TypeScript compiler to verify no type errors in filter logic
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1, 3.2_

  - [x] 3.2 Add creator filter indicator and clear functionality

    - Create filter indicator component to show active creator filter
    - Display "Showing posts by [username]" when creator filter is active
    - Add clear filter button to remove creator filter while preserving other filters
    - Run TypeScript compiler to verify no type errors in indicator component
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1_

- [x] 4. Handle edge cases and error states

  - [x] 4.1 Implement no results handling for creator filter

    - Display appropriate message when selected creator has no posts matching current filters
    - Provide suggestions to adjust other filters or clear creator filter
    - Maintain good user experience when no posts are found
    - Run TypeScript compiler to verify no type errors in error handling logic
    - _Requirements: 4.4_

  - [x] 4.2 Add visual feedback for active creator filter

    - Highlight selected creator card when their filter is active
    - Update button state to show "Currently viewing" or similar indicator
    - Ensure clear visual distinction between filtered and unfiltered states
    - Run TypeScript compiler to verify no type errors in visual feedback logic
    - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 5. Add comprehensive testing

  - [x] 5.1 Write unit tests for creator filter logic

    - Test `applyFiltersDirectly` function with creator filter parameter
    - Test filter combination scenarios (creator + other filters)
    - Test edge cases like invalid creator ID and empty results
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1, 3.2_

  - [x] 5.2 Write component tests for creator filter UI

    - Test CreatorFilterButton component behavior and states
    - Test creator filter indicator display and clear functionality
    - Test integration with existing creator cards
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 6. Optimize performance and finalize integration


  - [x] 6.1 Optimize creator filter performance

    - Ensure efficient filtering without duplicate posts
    - Leverage existing deduplication logic for creator-filtered posts
    - Test performance with large datasets and multiple active filters
    - Run TypeScript compiler to verify no type errors in optimization code
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

  - [x] 6.2 Final integration and polish

    - Ensure creator filter works seamlessly with existing search functionality
    - Test complete user flow from search to creator selection to filtered results
    - Verify all requirements are met and user experience is smooth
    - Run final TypeScript compiler check to ensure no type errors in entire feature
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
