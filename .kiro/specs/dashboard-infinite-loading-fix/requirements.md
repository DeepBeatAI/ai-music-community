# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The dashboard page is experiencing an infinite loading loop where the "Fetching from server..." component continuously loads, resets, and loads again. This is causing React's "Maximum update depth exceeded" error due to a useEffect dependency cycle. The issue stems from including `paginationState` in a useEffect dependency array that also calls `fetchPosts`, which updates the pagination state, creating an endless loop.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Infinite Loading Loop

**User Story:** As a user visiting the dashboard, I want the page to load posts once and show the load more button properly, so that I don't experience constant loading states and React errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard page loads THEN the initial posts should be fetched exactly once
2. WHEN the initial posts are loaded THEN the loading state should stop and show the posts
3. WHEN there are more posts available THEN the load more button should appear below the posts
4. WHEN the load more button is clicked THEN additional posts should be fetched without triggering a reload of existing posts
5. WHEN the pagination state changes THEN it should not trigger a refetch of the initial posts

### Requirement 2: Remove Problematic useEffect Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the useEffect dependencies to be correctly structured, so that state updates don't cause infinite re-renders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard component mounts THEN the initial data fetch should only depend on user authentication state
2. WHEN the pagination state updates THEN it should not trigger the initial data loading useEffect
3. WHEN the fetchPosts function is called THEN it should not cause the component to re-fetch data automatically
4. WHEN the component re-renders THEN the useEffect should not run unless the user authentication state actually changes

### Requirement 3: Maintain Load More Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want the load more functionality to continue working properly after the infinite loading fix, so that I can still browse through all available posts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the load more button THEN additional posts should be appended to the existing list
2. WHEN there are no more posts to load THEN the load more button should disappear or show an end-of-content message
3. WHEN the load more operation completes THEN the loading state should be cleared properly
4. WHEN I perform a search THEN the load more functionality should work with filtered results

### Requirement 4: Preserve Search and Filter Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want search and filtering to continue working normally after the fix, so that I can still discover content effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search for posts THEN the results should display without triggering infinite loading
2. WHEN I apply filters THEN the filtered results should show without causing re-render loops
3. WHEN I clear search or filters THEN the page should return to the normal post feed without infinite loading
4. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the pagination should work correctly with the filtered data

### Requirement 5: Eliminate React Error Messages

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use the dashboard without seeing error messages in the browser console, so that the application feels stable and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN there should be no "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors in the console
2. WHEN I interact with the load more functionality THEN there should be no React warning messages
3. WHEN the pagination state updates THEN there should be no infinite re-render warnings
4. WHEN I navigate to and from the dashboard THEN there should be no memory leaks or cleanup warnings
