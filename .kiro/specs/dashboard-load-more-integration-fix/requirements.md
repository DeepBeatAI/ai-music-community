# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The dashboard Load More button currently has integration bugs when used in combination with search functionality and filters. Users experience inconsistent behavior where the Load More button either doesn't work correctly after applying filters/search, shows incorrect pagination states, or fails to maintain proper state synchronization between different interaction modes (filtered vs unfiltered content).

This feature aims to create a robust, unified pagination system that seamlessly handles all combinations of search, filters, and Load More functionality while maintaining optimal performance and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing the dashboard, I want the Load More button to work consistently regardless of whether I have applied search terms or filters, so that I can access all available content without confusion or broken functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I load the dashboard initially THEN the system SHALL display the first 15 posts with a Load More button if more posts exist
2. WHEN I click Load More on unfiltered content THEN the system SHALL fetch the next 15 posts from the server and append them to the current display
3. WHEN I apply any filter or search term THEN the Load More button SHALL continue to work correctly for the filtered/searched results
4. WHEN I have filtered content displayed THEN clicking Load More SHALL show more results from the filtered dataset using client-side pagination
5. WHEN I clear filters or search terms THEN the pagination state SHALL reset properly and Load More SHALL work for unfiltered content again

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user applying filters after loading more content, I want the filters to work on all loaded posts and maintain proper pagination, so that I can effectively discover content without losing my browsing progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click Load More multiple times to load 30+ posts THEN apply a filter THEN the system SHALL filter all loaded posts, not just the initial 15
2. WHEN filtering shows more than 15 results THEN the system SHALL display the first 15 filtered results with a Load More button for the remaining filtered results
3. WHEN I click Load More on filtered results THEN the system SHALL show the next batch of filtered results without making server requests
4. WHEN filtered results show fewer than 15 posts AND more matching posts exist in the database THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch additional posts to provide comprehensive filtering
5. IF automatic fetching occurs THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback and maintain performance standards

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user combining search and filters, I want the Load More functionality to work seamlessly with both active simultaneously, so that I can refine my content discovery without encountering broken pagination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform a search AND apply filters THEN the Load More button SHALL work correctly for the combined search and filter results
2. WHEN search results combined with filters show more than 15 items THEN the system SHALL paginate through the combined results properly
3. WHEN I clear search terms but keep filters active THEN the Load More button SHALL transition correctly to filter-only mode
4. WHEN I clear filters but keep search terms active THEN the Load More button SHALL transition correctly to search-only mode
5. WHEN I clear both search and filters THEN the system SHALL reset to unfiltered pagination mode with proper Load More functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback about the Load More button state and loading progress, so that I understand what content is available and when actions are in progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Load More button is loading content THEN the system SHALL display a loading state with appropriate text and disabled button
2. WHEN no more content is available THEN the system SHALL hide the Load More button or show an appropriate end-of-content message
3. WHEN switching between filtered and unfiltered modes THEN the system SHALL update the Load More button state immediately to reflect the new context
4. WHEN automatic fetching occurs for comprehensive filtering THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
5. WHEN Load More actions complete THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback showing the new content count

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want comprehensive error handling and state management for the Load More functionality, so that edge cases are handled gracefully and debugging is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur during Load More operations THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and allow retry attempts
2. WHEN concurrent Load More requests are triggered THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate requests and maintain consistent state
3. WHEN state transitions occur between different pagination modes THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and prevent race conditions
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging for all Load More operations and state changes
5. IF edge cases occur (empty results, API failures, etc.) THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking the user interface

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user on a mobile device or slow connection, I want the Load More functionality to be performant and bandwidth-efficient, so that I can browse content smoothly regardless of my device or connection quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Load More on unfiltered content THEN the system SHALL fetch exactly 15 posts per request to optimize bandwidth usage
2. WHEN filtering requires additional data THEN the system SHALL fetch only the minimum necessary posts to provide comprehensive filtering
3. WHEN using client-side pagination for filtered results THEN the system SHALL not make unnecessary server requests
4. WHEN Load More operations complete THEN the response time SHALL be under 2 seconds for server requests and under 500ms for client-side pagination
5. WHEN memory usage increases due to loaded content THEN the system SHALL maintain reasonable memory consumption and consider cleanup strategies for very long browsing sessions
