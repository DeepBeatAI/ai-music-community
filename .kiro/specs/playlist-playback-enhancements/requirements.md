# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing playlist system with comprehensive playback capabilities, including sequential track playback, playback controls (play/pause from any track, repeat, shuffle), drag-and-drop track reordering, and a persistent mini audio player that remains visible across page navigation. These enhancements transform playlists from static collections into fully functional playback experiences, significantly improving user engagement and content consumption on the AI Music Community Platform.

## Glossary

- **Playlist Playback**: Sequential playing of tracks in a playlist with automatic progression
- **Mini Player**: A persistent, compact audio player that remains visible across all pages during playlist playback
- **Playback Context**: The current state of playlist playback including active playlist, current track, position, and playback mode
- **Shuffle Mode**: Randomized track playback order within a playlist
- **Repeat Mode**: Continuous playback options (off, repeat playlist, repeat single track)
- **Track Queue**: The ordered list of tracks to be played based on current playback mode
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: User interface pattern allowing manual track position changes by dragging
- **Public Playlists Section**: Display area showing playlists created by other users that are marked as public
- **Own Playlists Section**: Display area showing playlists created by the authenticated user
