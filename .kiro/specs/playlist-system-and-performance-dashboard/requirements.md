# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive playlist management system and a unified performance monitoring dashboard for the AI Music Community Platform. The playlist system enables users to create, organize, and manage collections of audio tracks with public/private visibility controls. The performance dashboard consolidates scattered monitoring components into a unified interface for tracking application performance, cache efficiency, and bandwidth usage. These features enhance user experience through better content organization and provide developers with essential tools for performance optimization.

## Glossary

- **Playlist**: A user-created collection of audio tracks with metadata (name, description, visibility)
- **Track**: An audio file uploaded to the platform with associated metadata
- **RLS (Row Level Security)**: PostgreSQL security feature that restricts database row access based on user identity
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Percentage of requests served from cache versus fetching from origin
- **Performance Dashboard**: Developer tool for monitoring application metrics in real-time
- **Public Playlist**: A playlist visible to all platform users
- **Private Playlist**: A playlist visible only to its creator
- **Playlist Track**: A junction record linking a track to a playlist with position information

## Requirements

4. WHEN a user attempts to DELETE a playlist THEN the System SHALL verify the user owns the playlist
5. WHEN a user attempts to add tracks to a playlist THEN the System SHALL verify the user owns the playlist
6. WHEN a user attempts to remove tracks from a playlist THEN the System SHALL verify the user owns the playlist

### Requirement 5: Performance Dashboard Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified performance monitoring dashboard, so that I can track application metrics in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the System SHALL display a performance dashboard button in the bottom-right corner

3. WHEN the dashboard is open THEN the System SHALL display four tabs: Overview, Performance, Cache, and Bandwidth
4. WHEN a user clicks a tab THEN the System SHALL switch to that tab's content
5. WHEN a user clicks the close button THEN the System SHALL collapse the dashboard to button state
6. WHEN the dashboard is open THEN the System SHALL provide an auto-refresh toggle option
7. WHEN auto-refresh is enabled THEN the System SHALL update metrics every 5 seconds

### Requirement 6: Performance Metrics Tracking

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to track performance metrics, so that I can identify optimization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN the Bandwidth tab is active THEN the System SHALL display total transfer, cached transfer, and saved bandwidth
5. WHEN metrics are updated THEN the System SHALL persist data in localStorage for session continuity
6. WHEN a user clicks "Generate Report" THEN the System SHALL log performance data to the console
7. WHEN a user clicks "Clear" on cache data THEN the System SHALL remove the specified cache from localStorage
