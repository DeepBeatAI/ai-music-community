## Bug #1: Edited Badge Disappears on Page Reload (Posts Only)

### Issue
**Test Case:** 1.4 - Verify Post Update Persists  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** The "Edited" badge was displaying correctly after editing a post, but disappeared when the page was refreshed. This only affected posts, not comments.

### Root Cause
Three issues were identified:
1. The EditedBadge component was being rendered outside of the PostItem component, in a separate div that wasn't part of the post data flow
2. The `onUpdate` callback in the dashboard wasn't properly updating the post in the pagination manager
3. **Most Critical:** The `updatePost` function in `client/src/utils/posts.ts` wasn't explicitly updating the `updated_at` field in the database, so even though the trigger should handle it, the timestamp wasn't being updated reliably

### Fix Applied
**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/components/EditablePost.tsx`
- `client/src/components/PostItem.tsx`
- `client/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `client/src/utils/posts.ts` ← **Critical fix**

**Changes:**
1. Modified `EditablePost` to pass the EditedBadge as a prop to `PostItem` instead of rendering it separately
2. Updated `PostItem` interface to accept `editedBadge?: React.ReactNode` prop
3. Moved EditedBadge rendering inside PostItem's content area (within the post border, BEFORE audio player for audio posts)
4. Updated dashboard's `onUpdate` callback to update posts in pagination manager state
5. **Most Important:** Modified `updatePost()` function to explicitly set `updated_at` timestamp in the database
6. Badge now persists correctly because the database is properly updated with the new timestamp

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// EditablePost.tsx - Pass badge as prop
<PostItem
  post={localPost}
  currentUserId={currentUserId}
  onDelete={onDelete}
  showWaveform={showWaveform}
  editedBadge={
    localPost.created_at && localPost.updated_at ? (
      <EditedBadge
        createdAt={localPost.created_at}
        updatedAt={localPost.updated_at}
      />
    ) : undefined
  }
/>

// PostItem.tsx - Render badge BEFORE audio player
{/* Edited Badge - Show before audio player */}
{editedBadge && (
  <div className={post.content ? "pt-2" : ""}>
    {editedBadge}
  </div>
)}

{/* Audio Player */}
{post.post_type === 'audio' && post.audio_url && (
  <AudioPlayerSection post={post} showWaveform={showWaveform} />
)}

// dashboard/page.tsx - Update local state
onUpdate={(postId, newContent) => {
  const currentState = paginationManager.getState();
  const updatedPosts = currentState.allPosts.map(p => 
    p.id === postId 
      ? { ...p, content: newContent, updated_at: new Date().toISOString() }
      : p
  );
  paginationManager.updatePosts({ newPosts: updatedPosts });
}}

// posts.ts - THE CRITICAL FIX: Update database with timestamp
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('posts')
  .update({ 
    content: content.trim(),
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString()  // ← Explicitly set timestamp
  })
  .eq('id', postId)
  .eq('user_id', userId);
```

### Verification
- [x] Edit a post and verify badge appears
- [x] Refresh the page
- [x] Verify badge still appears after refresh
- [x] Verify badge shows correct timestamp on hover
- [x] Verify badge appears BEFORE audio player for audio posts

## Bug #2: Multiple Comments Can Be Edited Simultaneously

### Issue
**Test Case:** 4.7 - Only One Comment in Edit Mode  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** Users could click "Edit" on multiple comments, causing multiple comment edit forms to be open at the same time. This violates the requirement that only one comment should be editable at a time.

### Root Cause
Each Comment component managed its own `isEditing` state independently, with no coordination between comments. There was no parent-level state management to track which comment was currently being edited.

### Fix Applied
**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/components/CommentList.tsx`
- `client/src/components/Comment.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. Added `editingCommentId` state to CommentList component to track which comment is being edited
2. Added `onEditStart` and `onEditEnd` callbacks to notify parent when edit mode changes
3. Updated Comment component to accept these props and call them appropriately
4. Added useEffect in Comment to automatically close edit mode when another comment starts editing
5. Passed edit state props down to nested replies recursively

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// CommentList.tsx - Add edit state management
const [editingCommentId, setEditingCommentId] = useState<string | null>(null);

<Comment
  editingCommentId={editingCommentId}
  onEditStart={(commentId) => setEditingCommentId(commentId)}
  onEditEnd={() => setEditingCommentId(null)}
  // ... other props
/>

// Comment.tsx - Close edit mode when another comment is edited
useEffect(() => {
  if (isEditing && editingCommentId && editingCommentId !== comment.id) {
    // Another comment is being edited, close this one
    setIsEditing(false);
    setEditContent(localComment.content);
    setEditError(null);
  }
}, [editingCommentId, comment.id, isEditing, localComment.content]);
```

### Verification
- [x] Click "Edit" on Comment A
- [x] Verify Comment A enters edit mode
- [x] Click "Edit" on Comment B
- [x] Verify Comment A automatically exits edit mode
- [x] Verify Comment B enters edit mode
- [x] Verify only one comment is in edit mode at any time
- [x] Test with nested replies

## Bug #3: Edited Badge Positioning (Posts)

### Issue
**Test Case:** 5.1 - Edited Badge Appears After Edit  
**Severity:** Low (UX/Visual)  
**Description:** The edited badge for posts was displaying below the post border, outside the post container. The user wanted it positioned inside the post border for better visual consistency.

### Root Cause
The EditedBadge was being rendered in a separate div outside of the PostItem component structure, causing it to appear below the post's border.

### Fix Applied
**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/components/EditablePost.tsx`
- `client/src/components/PostItem.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. Moved EditedBadge rendering from outside PostItem to inside PostItem's content area
2. Badge is now rendered within the `<div className="p-4 space-y-4">` section
3. Added padding-top to create visual separation from content
4. Badge now appears inside the post border, maintaining visual hierarchy

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// PostItem.tsx - Badge inside content area
<div className="p-4 space-y-4">
  {/* Text Content */}
  {post.content && (
    <div className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
      {truncateText(post.content, 500)}
    </div>
  )}

  {/* Audio Player */}
  {post.post_type === 'audio' && post.audio_url && (
    <AudioPlayerSection post={post} showWaveform={showWaveform} />
  )}

  {/* Edited Badge - Now inside post border */}
  {editedBadge && (
    <div className="pt-2">
      {editedBadge}
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```

### Verification
- [x] Edit a post
- [x] Verify badge appears inside the post border
- [x] Verify badge is visually aligned with post content
- [x] Verify badge doesn't break layout on mobile

## Bug #4: CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) Performance Issue

### Issue
**Test Case:** 11.1 - Edit Mode Performance  
**Severity:** Medium (Performance)  
**Description:** Performance testing showed a CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) score of 0.15, which needs improvement. The issue was caused by the EditedBadge appearing/disappearing, causing content to shift.

**Performance Metrics:**
- CLS Score: 0.15 (needs improvement)
- Layout Shift Score: 0.1451
- Threshold: < 0.1 is good, 0.1-0.25 needs improvement

### Root Cause
The EditedBadge component returned `null` when content wasn't edited, causing the space it would occupy to collapse. When the badge appeared after editing, it pushed other content down, creating a layout shift.

### Fix Applied
**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/components/EditedBadge.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. Instead of returning `null` when not edited, render an invisible placeholder
2. Placeholder has same dimensions as the visible badge
3. Uses `opacity-0` and `pointer-events-none` to hide without removing from layout
4. Reserves space in the layout, preventing shift when badge appears

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// EditedBadge.tsx - Reserve space to prevent layout shift
if (!isEdited) {
  return (
    <span 
      className="inline-flex items-center text-xs md:text-sm opacity-0 pointer-events-none" 
      aria-hidden="true"
    >
      (Edited)
    </span>
  );
}
```

### Verification
- [x] Run performance test before edit
- [x] Edit a post
- [x] Run performance test after edit
- [x] Verify CLS score improves to < 0.1
- [x] Verify no visible layout shifts occur
- [x] Test on mobile devices

---

## Additional Improvements

### Edit Button Integration
As part of fixing Bug #1, the edit button was also moved inside the PostItem component for better integration:

**Changes:**
- Edit button now passed as `editButton` prop to PostItem
- Rendered in the header alongside Follow and Delete buttons
- Maintains consistent positioning and styling
- Better integration with post component lifecycle

---

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
1. Add animation when badge appears to make transition smoother
2. Consider adding edit history (show all edit timestamps)
3. Add "edited by" indicator for collaborative editing scenarios
4. Optimize CLS further by pre-rendering badge space in SSR

### Known Limitations
1. CLS improvement depends on consistent badge sizing across devices
2. Edit state management doesn't persist across page reloads (by design)
3. Nested comment edit coordination limited to 3 levels (by design)

---

## Conclusion

All four bugs identified during UX testing have been successfully fixed:
1. ✅ Edited badge now persists after page reload (fixed badge integration + pagination manager update)
2. ✅ Only one comment can be edited at a time (centralized edit state management)
3. ✅ Edited badge positioned inside post border and BEFORE audio player (proper placement in content flow)
4. ✅ CLS performance improved with layout reservation (invisible placeholder prevents layout shift)

The fixes maintain backward compatibility, don't require database changes, and improve both functionality and performance of the post-editing feature.

### Key Improvements:
- **Badge Persistence**: Integrated badge into PostItem component and ensured post updates are persisted via pagination manager
- **Badge Positioning**: Badge now appears inside post border, before audio player for better visual hierarchy
- **Edit Coordination**: Centralized edit state prevents multiple comments from being edited simultaneously
- **Performance**: CLS score improved by reserving space for badge even when not visible
