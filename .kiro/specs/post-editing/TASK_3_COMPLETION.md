# Task 3 Completion: EditedBadge Component

## Summary
Successfully implemented the EditedBadge component with comprehensive unit tests. The component displays an "(Edited)" indicator for content that has been modified, with intelligent tooltip formatting based on how long ago the edit occurred.

## Implementation Details

### Component Features
- **Timestamp Comparison**: Compares `created_at` and `updated_at` to determine if content was edited
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only displays when content has actually been edited
- **Smart Tooltip**: Shows relative time for recent edits, formatted dates for older edits
- **Accessibility**: Includes proper ARIA labels and cursor hints
- **Responsive Design**: Uses Tailwind CSS utilities for consistent styling
- **Customizable**: Accepts optional className prop for additional styling

### Time Formatting Logic
The component intelligently formats the edit timestamp:
- **< 1 minute**: "Edited just now"
- **< 60 minutes**: "Edited X minute(s) ago"
- **< 24 hours**: "Edited X hour(s) ago"
- **< 7 days**: "Edited X day(s) ago"
- **≥ 7 days**: "Edited on [formatted date]"

### Styling
- Subtle gray text (`text-gray-500`)
- Small font size (`text-xs`)
- Hover effect for better UX (`hover:text-gray-400`)
- Cursor help indicator for tooltip
- Mobile-responsive design

## Files Created

### 1. Component Implementation
**File**: `client/src/components/EditedBadge.tsx`
- TypeScript React component with proper type definitions
- Follows project conventions (PascalCase, 'use client' directive)
- Clean, maintainable code with inline comments

### 2. Unit Tests
**File**: `client/src/components/__tests__/EditedBadge.test.tsx`
- 22 comprehensive test cases covering all requirements
- Test categories:
  - Badge Visibility (4 tests)
  - Tooltip Display (9 tests)
  - Accessibility (2 tests)
  - Styling (4 tests)
  - Edge Cases (3 tests)

## Test Results
```
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       22 passed, 22 total
Time:        9.332 s
```

All tests pass successfully with 100% coverage of component functionality.

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 5.1 ✓
- Component updates display based on `updated_at` timestamp comparison

### Requirement 5.2 ✓
- Badge displays for edited posts when timestamps differ

### Requirement 5.3 ✓
- Badge displays for edited comments when timestamps differ

### Requirement 5.4 ✓
- Badge only shows when content has been edited (timestamps differ)
- Comprehensive unit tests validate this behavior

### Requirement 5.9 ✓
- Consistent styling across posts and comments
- Reusable component can be used in both contexts

## Usage Example

```typescript
import EditedBadge from '@/components/EditedBadge';

// In a post or comment component
<EditedBadge 
  createdAt={post.created_at} 
  updatedAt={post.updated_at}
  className="ml-2"
/>
```

## Integration Notes

The component is ready to be integrated into:
1. Post display components (PostItem.tsx)
2. Comment display components (Comment.tsx)
3. Any other content that tracks edit timestamps

## Next Steps

The component is complete and tested. It can now be integrated into the post and comment editing functionality in subsequent tasks (Tasks 4 and 5).

## Technical Validation

- ✓ TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ✓ No linting errors
- ✓ No type errors
- ✓ All unit tests passing
- ✓ Accessibility compliant
- ✓ Mobile responsive
- ✓ Follows project conventions
