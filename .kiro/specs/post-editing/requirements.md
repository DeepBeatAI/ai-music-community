# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to edit their posts and comments after publication. For text-only posts, users can edit the entire content. For audio posts, users can only edit the text/caption portion while the audio file remains immutable. Comments can be fully edited by their authors. All edited content displays an "Edited" badge to maintain transparency. This provides users with flexibility to correct mistakes, update information, or improve their content while maintaining the integrity of audio uploads and content transparency.
