# Implementation Plan: Track Metadata Enhancements

This implementation plan breaks down the track metadata enhancements into discrete, manageable coding tasks. Each task builds incrementally on previous work following the priority order: Track Description → Track Author → Play Count Tracking.

## Priority Order

**Phase 1**: Track Description vs Post Caption Separation (4-6 hours)

## Task Execution Guidelines

### Prerequisites
- Supabase CLI installed and configured
- Local development database running
- All dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- Development server can run (`npm run dev`)

### Execution Order
Tasks MUST be executed in phase order (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3). Within each phase, tasks should be completed sequentially as they have dependencies.

### Testing Requirements
- Run TypeScript checks after each task: `npm run type-check`
- Run ESLint after each task: `npm run lint`
- Fix all errors before proceeding to next task
- Manual testing should be performed after completing each phase
- Database migrations should be tested on development database before production

### Git Workflow
- Commit after completing each major task
- Use descriptive commit messages referencing task numbers
- Example: "feat: Add track description field to upload form (Task 1.2.1)"
- Push regularly to backup progress

### Pause Points for User Testing
After completing each phase, pause for user testing:
1. **After Phase 1**: Test track description vs post caption separation
2. **After Phase 2**: Test track author field and immutability
3. **After Phase 3**: Test play count tracking and analytics dashboard

### Success Criteria

**Phase 1 Complete When:**
- ✅ Migration runs successfully
- ✅ Track descriptions and post captions are separated
- ✅ Upload form has both fields
- ✅ All display components show correct field
- ✅ No TypeScript or linting errors
- ✅ Manual testing confirms correct behavior

**Phase 2 Complete When:**
- ✅ Migration runs successfully
- ✅ All tracks have author field populated
- ✅ Author field is mandatory during upload
- ✅ Author cannot be edited after upload
- ✅ Warning message is clear and visible
- ✅ All display components show track.author
- ✅ No TypeScript or linting errors
- ✅ Manual testing confirms correct behavior

**Phase 3 Complete When:**
- ✅ Migration runs successfully
- ✅ Play counts increment correctly (30+ seconds)
- ✅ Plays under 30 seconds don't count
- ✅ Debounce prevents duplicate counts
- ✅ Failed plays are queued and retried
- ✅ "Most Popular" sorting works
- ✅ All 4 analytics sections display on /analytics/
- ✅ All 4 analytics sections display on /discover/
- ✅ Queries complete in < 200ms
- ✅ No TypeScript or linting errors
- ✅ Manual testing confirms correct behavior
