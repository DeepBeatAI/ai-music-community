# Implementation Plan: Tracks vs Posts Separation

## ✅ FEATURE COMPLETE - ALL TASKS DONE

**Status**: 🎉 **Tracks-Posts Separation is FULLY IMPLEMENTED and DEPLOYED**

**Completion Summary**:
- ✅ **Phases 1-10**: Fully implemented and tested (code, database, UI, documentation)
- ✅ **Phase 11**: Documentation created for future production deployment
- ✅ **Phase 12**: Not required (pre-production environment only)

**What was accomplished**:
- All code changes implemented and working
- Database migrations applied to pre-production
- Comprehensive testing completed (unit, integration, manual)
- Full documentation created
- Feature deployed and operational in pre-production

**Important Notes**:
- **Phases 11-12** created reference documentation for a future production deployment
- Since the project is in pre-production (no separate production environment), these deployment procedures are **not needed yet**
- The deployment docs will be valuable when launching to real users

**See**: `docs/features/tracks-vs-posts-separation/analysis/deployment-status-analysis.md` for detailed explanation
