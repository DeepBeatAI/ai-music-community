# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current "Auto TypeScript Compiler" hook successfully executes and fixes TypeScript errors, but it sometimes misses remaining errors before announcing completion. This enhancement will improve the hook's thoroughness by implementing a comprehensive double-check validation system that ensures all TypeScript errors are resolved before declaring the work complete.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the TypeScript error checker hook, I want the hook to perform a comprehensive final validation check so that I can be confident all TypeScript errors have been resolved before the hook reports completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hook completes its error fixing process THEN it SHALL perform a final comprehensive TypeScript compilation check
2. WHEN the final check detects any remaining TypeScript errors THEN the hook SHALL continue the fixing process rather than reporting completion
3. WHEN the final check finds zero TypeScript errors THEN the hook SHALL report successful completion with a summary of all fixes applied
4. WHEN multiple error-fix cycles are needed THEN the hook SHALL track and report the number of iterations performed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the hook to provide detailed reporting of its validation process so that I can understand what errors were found and how they were resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hook performs error detection THEN it SHALL report the total number of errors found before starting fixes
2. WHEN the hook applies fixes THEN it SHALL document each fix with the file location and type of error resolved
3. WHEN the hook performs the final validation THEN it SHALL explicitly confirm zero errors remain with a clear success message
4. WHEN the hook completes multiple iterations THEN it SHALL provide a summary showing the progression from initial error count to zero

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the hook to handle edge cases and prevent infinite loops so that the error checking process is reliable and terminates appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hook detects the same errors persisting after multiple fix attempts THEN it SHALL report the persistent errors and stop to prevent infinite loops
2. WHEN the hook encounters compilation errors it cannot automatically fix THEN it SHALL report these errors clearly and request manual intervention
3. WHEN the hook runs for more than a reasonable number of iterations THEN it SHALL implement a safety limit and report the situation
4. WHEN the TypeScript compiler itself fails to run THEN the hook SHALL detect this condition and report the infrastructure issue

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enhanced hook to maintain backward compatibility so that existing workflows continue to function without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the enhanced hook is deployed THEN it SHALL maintain the same trigger conditions as the current version
2. WHEN the enhanced hook runs THEN it SHALL preserve the same manual button functionality for on-demand checking
3. WHEN the enhanced hook completes successfully THEN it SHALL provide output format compatible with existing development workflows
4. WHEN the enhanced hook encounters errors THEN it SHALL maintain the same error reporting structure while adding enhanced validation details
