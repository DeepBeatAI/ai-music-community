# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create enhanced hook prompt with validation loop logic

  - Design comprehensive multi-phase prompt structure that implements initial error detection, iterative fixing, and final validation
  - Include specific instructions for error counting, fix tracking, and iteration management
  - Implement safety mechanisms within the prompt to prevent infinite loops
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 2. Implement error detection and reporting enhancements

  - Create detailed error parsing logic within the prompt instructions
  - Add comprehensive error categorization (syntax, type, import, configuration)

  - Implement initial error count reporting and error signature tracking
  - Include instructions for documenting each fix with file location and error type
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 1.1_

- [x] 3. Add iterative validation loop with safety mechanisms

  - Implement iteration counter logic within the prompt structure
  - Add error persistence detection by comparing error signatures between iterations
  - Create maximum iteration limit (5 cycles) with graceful termination
  - Include instructions for detecting and reporting stuck errors that cannot be automatically fixed
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Enhance final validation and success reporting

  - Implement comprehensive final TypeScript compilation check instructions
  - Add explicit zero-error confirmation requirements before completion reporting
  - Create detailed success message format with fix summary and iteration count
  - Include progression reporting from initial error count to final resolution
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Update hook configuration with enhanced prompt

  - Modify the existing `.kiro/hooks/ts-error-checker.kiro.hook` file with the new prompt
  - Increment version number to reflect the enhancement
  - Update description to reflect the new comprehensive validation capabilities
  - Preserve all existing trigger conditions for backward compatibility
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_


- [x] 6. Create comprehensive testing validation script







  - Write test scenarios to validate the enhanced hook behavior
  - Create test cases for no errors, simple errors, multiple iterations, and persistent errors
  - Implement validation for safety mechanisms and infinite loop prevention
  - Test manual trigger functionality and backward compatibility
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 7. Document the enhanced hook functionality







  - Create user documentation explaining the new validation loop behavior
  - Document the safety mechanisms and iteration limits
  - Provide examples of enhanced error reporting and success messages
  - Include troubleshooting guide for cases requiring manual intervention
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
