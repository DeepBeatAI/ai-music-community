# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for optimizing the Enhanced TypeScript Error Checker hook's final reporting to be concise and focused, reducing the verbose output to a maximum of 50 words while maintaining essential information for developers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the TypeScript Error Checker hook, I want the final success report to be concise and scannable, so that I can quickly understand the results without reading through lengthy output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TypeScript error checking process completes successfully THEN the final report SHALL be limited to a maximum of 50 words
2. WHEN displaying the final report THEN the system SHALL include only the most critical information: error count resolved, iteration count, and success confirmation
3. WHEN the hook completes THEN the system SHALL use clear, actionable language without excessive formatting or decorative elements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer reviewing hook output, I want to see essential metrics at a glance, so that I can quickly assess the impact and success of the error resolution process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating the final report THEN the system SHALL display the initial error count and final error count (0)
2. WHEN showing completion status THEN the system SHALL indicate the number of iterations required
3. WHEN reporting success THEN the system SHALL confirm zero errors remain with a clear success indicator

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the hook regularly, I want consistent and predictable output format, so that I can quickly parse the results across different runs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating the final report THEN the system SHALL use a standardized format with consistent structure
2. WHEN displaying metrics THEN the system SHALL use clear numerical indicators without verbose explanations
3. WHEN confirming completion THEN the system SHALL use a single, clear success statement

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working in a fast-paced environment, I want the hook output to be terminal-friendly and easy to scan, so that I can quickly move on to the next task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN outputting the final report THEN the system SHALL use minimal formatting that works well in terminal environments
2. WHEN displaying the report THEN the system SHALL avoid multi-line decorative elements or excessive whitespace
3. WHEN showing results THEN the system SHALL prioritize information density over visual appeal
