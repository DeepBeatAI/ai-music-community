# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create report template system and word counting utilities

  - Implement compact report templates with placeholder substitution
  - Create word counting utility function that accurately counts words in generated reports
  - Develop template selection logic based on data complexity and word limits
  - Write unit tests for template generation and word counting accuracy
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 2. Implement report data extraction and formatting logic

  - Create data extraction functions to pull essential metrics from hook execution
  - Implement number formatting utilities for clean metric display
  - Develop success/failure determination logic based on error resolution results
  - Write unit tests for data extraction and formatting functions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 4.1_

- [x] 3. Replace verbose reporting section in TypeScript hook

  - Locate and backup the current Phase 4 reporting section in the hook file
  - Replace verbose reporting with compact report generation calls
  - Preserve all existing error detection, resolution, and safety mechanisms
  - Ensure hook trigger conditions and execution flow remain unchanged
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.2_

- [x] 4. Implement word count validation and fallback mechanisms

  - Add word count validation before final report output
  - Implement fallback to shorter templates if word limit exceeded

  - Create absolute minimum template for edge cases where all templates are too long
  - Add error handling for template generation failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1_

- [x] 5. Test hook with various error scenarios and validate compliance

  - Test hook execution with different error counts (0, 1, 10, 50+ errors)
  - Verify 50-word limit compliance across all test scenarios
  - Validate that essential information (error counts, iterations, success status) is preserved
  - Test hook performance to ensure no regression in execution time
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Create backup and rollback mechanisms


  - Create backup copy of original hook file with timestamp
  - Document the changes made for future reference
  - Test rollback procedure to ensure easy reversion if needed
  - Update hook documentation to reflect new compact reporting behavior
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 4.1_
