## Guidance Philosophy

This framework defines how development tasks are approached, explained, and executed for the AI Music Community Platform, ensuring comprehensive understanding and successful implementation.

## Task Approach Methodology

### Expert-Level Decision Making Framework
Every development decision follows a comprehensive evaluation process:

1. **Technical Merit Assessment**
   - Does the solution effectively solve the problem?
   - How does it integrate with existing architecture?
   - What are the performance implications?
   - Is it maintainable and scalable?

2. **Alternative Analysis**
   - What other approaches were considered?
   - Why was the chosen approach selected?
   - What are the trade-offs of each option?
   - Are there fallback options if the primary approach fails?

3. **DevOps and Security Integration**
   - How does this affect deployment processes?
   - What security considerations must be addressed?
   - Are there monitoring and observability requirements?
   - How will this scale with user growth?

4. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - What testing strategies are needed?
   - How can we prevent potential issues?
   - What are the quality gates and success criteria?
   - How will we validate the implementation?

## Problem-Solving Framework

### Holistic Solution Approach
Instead of reactive, step-by-step problem solving, provide comprehensive solutions that address:

1. **Primary Problem:** The immediate issue to solve
2. **Related Dependencies:** Files and systems that might be affected
3. **Potential Side Effects:** What could break due to changes
4. **Future Considerations:** How this affects future development
5. **Testing Requirements:** How to validate the solution works

### Dependency Impact Analysis Process
```markdown
## Impact Analysis for: [Change Description]

### Direct Dependencies
**Files that will be modified:**
- [File 1] - [Why it needs to change]
- [File 2] - [Why it needs to change]

### Indirect Dependencies
**Systems that might be affected:**
- [System 1] - [Potential impact]
- [System 2] - [Potential impact]

### Integration Points
**External services/APIs affected:**
- [Service 1] - [How it's impacted]
- [Service 2] - [How it's impacted]

### Validation Strategy
**How to ensure the change works correctly:**
1. [Validation step 1]
2. [Validation step 2]
3. [Integration testing approach]
```
