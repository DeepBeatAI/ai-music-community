## Key Features

### Playlist System
Create and manage collections of your favorite tracks:
- **Create Playlists**: Organize tracks into custom collections with names and descriptions
- **Privacy Controls**: Choose between public playlists (visible to all) or private playlists (personal only)
- **Track Management**: Add and remove tracks from playlists with position tracking
- **Playlist Discovery**: Browse your own playlists and discover public playlists from other users
- **Secure Access**: Row Level Security (RLS) ensures users can only modify their own playlists
- **Optimized Performance**: Indexed queries and efficient data fetching for fast load times

**Usage**:
1. Navigate to the "Playlists" section from the main navigation
2. Click "Create Playlist" to start a new collection
3. Add tracks to playlists using the "Add to Playlist" button on any track
4. View and manage your playlists from the playlists page
5. Click on a playlist to see all tracks and manage the collection

### Performance Dashboard
Real-time monitoring for developers and power users:
- **Overview Tab**: Session duration, cache hit rate, API calls saved, and optimization status
- **Performance Tab**: Component render tracking and effect execution monitoring
- **Cache Tab**: Detailed statistics for metadata, images, and audio caching
- **Bandwidth Tab**: Total transfer, cached transfer, and bandwidth savings metrics
- **Auto-Refresh**: Optional 5-second auto-refresh for live metric updates
- **Data Management**: Clear cache and bandwidth data, generate performance reports

**Access**: Click the performance dashboard button in the bottom-right corner of any page to expand the monitoring interface.

### Analytics System
Comprehensive metrics tracking with historical accuracy:
- Daily snapshots of platform activity
- Immutable historical data (survives content deletions)
- Automated daily collection via Edge Functions
- Performance-optimized queries (< 100ms)
- Extensible metric system

**Documentation**: See [Analytics System README](docs/features/analytics/README.md)
