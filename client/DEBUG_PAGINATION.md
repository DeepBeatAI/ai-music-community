## ðŸ”§ Quick Pagination Debug

### Check Console Logs:
Open your browser dev tools (F12) â†’ Console tab and look for these logs:

```
ðŸ“Š Total posts: [number], Current page: [X]/[Y], Server has more: [true/false]
ðŸ“Š Server-side pagination: Showing [X] posts, Page [Y]/[Z], Has more: [true/false]
```

### Expected Behavior:
1. **25 total posts** should show:
   - Page 1: Shows 15 posts
   - Server has more: true (because 25 > 15)
   - Load More button should appear

2. **After clicking Load More**:
   - Should load next 10 posts
   - Total showing: 25 posts
   - Server has more: false
   - "You've reached the end" should show

### If Still Broken:
The issue might be in the order of state updates. Try this:

1. **Refresh the page** (F5)
2. **Check browser console** for error messages
3. **Look for this specific log** pattern to debug:

```javascript
// Expected console output:
ðŸ“Š Total posts: 25, Current page: 1/2, Server has more: true
ðŸ“Š Server-side pagination: Showing 15 posts, Page 1/2, Has more: true
```

If you see `Has more: false` when it should be `true`, that's the bug location.

### Quick Fix Test:
Add this temporary debug in your browser console:

```javascript
// Check current state
console.log('Current pagination state:', {
  totalPostsCount: window.totalPostsCount,
  allPostsLength: window.allPostsLength,
  hasMorePosts: window.hasMorePosts
});
```

Let me know what the console shows and I'll provide the exact fix!
