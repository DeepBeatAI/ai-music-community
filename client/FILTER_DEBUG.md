## ðŸ”§ Debug Test: Filter Pagination Issues

### Testing Steps:

1. **Refresh page** (F5)
2. **Open Console** (F12)
3. **Filter by "Text Posts"**
4. **Look for these console logs:**

### Expected Debug Output:

**When you filter by "Text Posts":**
```
ðŸŽ¯ Filter state check: { filters: {...}, defaultFilters: {...}, filtersApplied: true/false }
ðŸ”„ Pagination reset triggered by search/filter change
ðŸ”„ Pagination reset
ðŸ“Š updatePagination called: { 
  isSearchActive: false, 
  hasFiltersApplied: true, 
  hasActiveFilters: true,
  currentPage: 1,
  displayPostsLength: 19,
  allPostsLength: 25
}
ðŸ“Š Client-side pagination calculation: {
  startIndex: 0,
  endIndex: 15,
  paginatedResultsLength: 15,
  totalFiltered: 19,
  hasMore: true
}
```

### Key Things to Check:

1. **`hasFiltersApplied`** - Should be `true` when you filter by "Text Posts"
2. **`displayPostsLength`** - Should be 19 (number of text posts)
3. **`paginatedResultsLength`** - Should be 15 (first page)
4. **`endIndex`** - Should be 15 (currentPage=1 * POSTS_PER_PAGE=15)

### If You See Issues:

**Problem 1: `hasFiltersApplied` is false**
- The SearchBar filter isn't being detected properly
- Need to check `currentSearchFilters` state

**Problem 2: `endIndex` is wrong (like 9)**
- `currentPage` or `POSTS_PER_PAGE` calculation is wrong
- Check if `currentPage` is actually 1

**Problem 3: `displayPostsLength` is wrong**
- The filter isn't working correctly
- Posts aren't being filtered to text posts only

Tell me exactly what you see in the console when you filter by "Text Posts"!
