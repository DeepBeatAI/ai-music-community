## 🔧 Search + Load More Integration Test

### Test Scenario: Filter by "Text Posts"

**Expected Behavior:**
- You have 19 text posts total
- Should show: **15 text posts** initially
- Load More button should show: **"Load More Posts (4 more)"**
- After clicking Load More: Show all **19 text posts**
- Then show: **"You've reached the end! All 19 matching posts loaded."**

### Testing Steps:

1. **Refresh the page** (F5)
2. **Open Console** (F12 → Console tab)
3. **Filter by "Text Posts"** in the SearchBar
4. **Watch console logs** - should show:
   ```
   🔄 Pagination reset triggered by search/filter change
   🔄 Pagination reset
   📊 Client-side pagination: Showing 15/19 filtered posts (Page 1), Has more: true
   ```

5. **Check UI**: Should show exactly 15 posts + "Load More Posts (4 more)" button

6. **Click "Load More Posts"** - console should show:
   ```
   🚀 Load more triggered
   🔍 Load more: Expanding filtered results to page 2 (client-side)
   Current filtered posts: 19, Currently showing: 15, Will show: 30
   📊 Client-side pagination: Showing 19/19 filtered posts (Page 2), Has more: false
   ```

7. **Check UI**: Should now show all 19 posts + "You've reached the end!" message

### If It's Still Not Working:

**Check these console logs:**
- Does `hasFiltersApplied` become `true` when you filter?
- Does `displayPosts.length` show 19?
- Does `currentPage` reset to 1?
- Does the pagination calculation show correct numbers?

**Quick Debug in Console:**
```javascript
// Paste this in browser console after filtering:
console.log('=== FILTER DEBUG ===');
console.log('Search active:', document.querySelector('[data-filter-active]'));
console.log('Should show Load More button for filters');
```

Let me know what the console shows when you filter by "Text Posts"!
