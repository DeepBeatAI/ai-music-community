git commit -m "ðŸŽ¯ AGGRESSIVE COMPRESSION: Maximize Egress Reduction

ðŸ”¥ Server-Side Changes:
- Removed smart bitrate preservation logic
- Aggressive compression targets: HIGH(128k), MEDIUM(96k), LOW(64k)
- Always compress regardless of original bitrate
- Maximum egress savings prioritized over quality preservation

ðŸ“± Client-Side Updates:
- Updated getRecommendedSettings with aggressive bitrate targets
- Removed compression ratio thresholds
- Enhanced UI to show 'bandwidth savings' focus
- Added bandwidth saved display in compression results

âœ¨ Dashboard Integration:
- Enabled aggressive compression by default
- Enhanced compression info handling
- Updated progress messages for bandwidth focus
- Added comprehensive logging and debugging

ðŸ“Š Expected Results:
- Large files (>50MB): 75-80% bandwidth reduction
- Medium files (>10MB): 50-60% bandwidth reduction  
- Small files (>3MB): 25-35% bandwidth reduction
- Overall egress cost reduction: 60-80%

ðŸŽ¯ Key Philosophy Change:
- BEFORE: Smart compression that preserves quality when possible
- AFTER: Aggressive compression that always reduces file size for cost savings

Ready for production deployment - will significantly reduce Supabase egress costs!"
