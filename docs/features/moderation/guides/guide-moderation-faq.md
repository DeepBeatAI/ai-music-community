# Moderation FAQ

## Frequently Asked Questions About Moderation

This document answers common questions about the moderation system, reporting content, and community guidelines on the AI Music Community Platform.

## General Questions

### What is moderation?

Moderation is the process of reviewing content and user behavior to ensure compliance with our [Community Guidelines](guide-community-guidelines.md). Our moderation team reviews reports, takes action on violations, and helps maintain a safe and respectful community.

### Who are the moderators?

Moderators are trusted community members and platform staff who have been granted special permissions to review reports and take action on guideline violations. They undergo training and follow established procedures to ensure fair and consistent enforcement.

### How do I become a moderator?

Moderator positions are typically offered to:
- Active, trusted community members
- Users with a history of positive contributions
- Individuals who demonstrate good judgment and fairness

We announce moderator applications when positions are available. Check platform announcements for opportunities.

## Reporting Content

### How do I report content?

1. Click the **report button (🚩)** on the content
2. Select the violation category
3. Provide additional details if needed
4. Submit your report

For detailed instructions, see the [User Reporting Guide](guide-user-reporting.md).

### What types of content can I report?

You can report:
- Posts
- Comments
- Tracks (audio content)
- User profiles

### What categories can I choose when reporting?

- Spam or Misleading Content
- Harassment or Bullying
- Hate Speech
- Inappropriate Content
- Copyright Violation
- Impersonation
- Self-Harm or Dangerous Acts
- Other (requires description)

### How many reports can I submit?

You can submit up to **10 reports per 24 hours**. This limit prevents abuse while allowing legitimate reporting.

### What happens if I exceed the report limit?

If you try to submit more than 10 reports in 24 hours, you'll see an error message and won't be able to submit additional reports until the time period expires.

### Can I report the same content multiple times?

No, submitting multiple reports for the same content doesn't speed up the review process. Submit one clear, detailed report per violation.

### Will the person I report know it was me?

No, your identity as a reporter is kept confidential. Only moderators and admins can see who submitted a report, and this information is used for accountability purposes only.

## After Reporting

### How long does it take for a report to be reviewed?

Review times depend on:
- **Priority level**: P1 (critical) reports are reviewed first
- **Queue volume**: The number of pending reports
- **Moderator availability**: Active moderator hours

Typical review times:
- **P1 (Critical)**: Within hours
- **P2 (High)**: Within 24 hours
- **P3 (Standard)**: Within 2-3 days
- **P4-P5 (Low)**: Within a week

### How is priority determined?

Priority is automatically assigned based on the violation category:
- **P1 (Critical)**: Self-harm or dangerous acts
- **P2 (High)**: Hate speech, harassment
- **P3 (Standard)**: Spam, inappropriate content, copyright
- **P4-P5 (Low)**: Other violations

### Will I be notified of the outcome?

Currently, reporters are not automatically notified of outcomes. However, you can:
- Check if the reported content has been removed
- See if the user's account status has changed

Future updates may include reporter notifications.

### What if my report is dismissed?

If your report is dismissed:
- The moderator determined the content doesn't violate guidelines
- The content remains on the platform
- Your report is logged for record-keeping
- You can still report other violations

This doesn't mean your report was wrong—interpretation of guidelines can vary, and context matters.

### Can I appeal a dismissed report?

There's currently no formal appeal process for dismissed reports. However:
- If you believe a serious violation was missed, you can submit a new report with more context
- Repeated reports of the same content may be flagged as abuse

## Moderation Actions

### What actions can moderators take?

Moderators can:
- Remove or hide content
- Issue warnings to users
- Apply restrictions (disable posting, commenting, or uploading)
- Suspend accounts temporarily (1, 7, or 30 days)
- Dismiss reports if no violation occurred

Admins can also permanently ban users for severe violations.

### What happens when content is removed?

When content is removed:
- The content is permanently deleted from the platform
- The content owner receives a notification explaining why
- The report is marked as "resolved"
- The action is logged in the moderation system

### What's the difference between suspension and restriction?

**Suspension:**
- Temporarily blocks all account activity
- Durations: 1, 7, or 30 days
- User cannot post, comment, upload, or interact
- Account is restored automatically when suspension expires

**Restriction:**
- Blocks specific activities only
- Types: Posting disabled, commenting disabled, or uploading disabled
- Can be temporary or permanent
- User can still use other platform features

### Can I appeal a moderation action?

Yes, if you believe a moderation action was taken in error:
1. Review the notification explaining the action
2. Check the [Community Guidelines](guide-community-guidelines.md)
3. Contact support through the help center
4. Provide context for why you believe the action was incorrect

**Note:** The formal appeal process is currently being developed.

### How long do suspensions last?

Temporary suspensions last:
- **1 day**: Minor violations or first-time offenses
- **7 days**: Moderate violations or repeated offenses
- **30 days**: Severe violations or multiple repeated offenses

Permanent bans are reserved for critical violations or users who repeatedly violate guidelines.

### Do violations expire from my record?

Moderation actions are logged indefinitely for accountability. However:
- Minor violations may not affect future moderation decisions
- Demonstrating improved behavior can influence future outcomes

Accidental reports happen. Don't worry:

- False reports don't automatically result in action
- Your report history is considered

However, repeatedly reporting content that doesn't violate guidelines may be flagged as abuse.

### What if someone is abusing the report system?

If you believe someone is abusing the reporting system:
- Contact support with evidence
- Don't retaliate by reporting their content
- Let moderators handle the situation

Abuse of the reporting system is taken seriously and may result in restrictions.

### Can I see who reported my content?

No, reporter identities are confidential. This protects users from retaliation and encourages honest reporting.

## Moderator Actions

### Can moderators see my private messages?

Moderators can only see:
- Public content (posts, comments, tracks)
- Reported content and context
- User profiles and public information

Private messages are not accessible to moderators unless specifically reported.

If you disagree with a moderation decision:
1. Review the reason provided in your notification
2. Check the [Community Guidelines](guide-community-guidelines.md)

4. Provide additional context if relevant

Moderators are human and can make mistakes. We review appeals carefully.

### Are moderators paid?

Moderator compensation varies:
- Some moderators are platform staff (paid)
- Some are volunteer community moderators
- All moderators follow the same guidelines and procedures

### Can moderators be reported?

Yes, if you believe a moderator is:
- Abusing their powers
- Acting unfairly or with bias

Contact support with specific details and evidence.
