# User Guide: Reporting Content

## Overview

This guide explains how to report content that violates community guidelines on the AI Music Community Platform. Our moderation system helps maintain a safe and respectful environment for all users.

## When to Report Content

You should report content when you encounter:

- **Spam or Misleading Content**: Repetitive posts, fake information, or deceptive content
- **Harassment or Bullying**: Targeted attacks, threats, or intimidating behavior
- **Hate Speech**: Content promoting hatred or discrimination based on identity
- **Inappropriate Content**: Content that violates platform standards or is unsuitable for the community
- **Copyright Violation**: Unauthorized use of copyrighted material
- **Impersonation**: Accounts pretending to be someone else
- **Self-Harm or Dangerous Acts**: Content promoting self-harm or dangerous behavior
- **Other Violations**: Any other content that violates community guidelines

## How to Report Content

### Step 1: Locate the Report Button

When viewing content (posts, comments, or tracks), look for the **report button (🚩)** typically located near the content.

### Step 2: Open the Report Modal

Click the report button to open the reporting form.

### Step 3: Select a Reason

Choose the category that best describes the violation:

1. Spam or Misleading Content
2. Harassment or Bullying
3. Hate Speech
4. Inappropriate Content
5. Copyright Violation
6. Impersonation
7. Self-Harm or Dangerous Acts
8. Other

### Step 4: Provide Additional Details (If Needed)

If you select "Other" as the reason, you'll be required to provide a text description explaining the violation. This helps moderators understand the specific issue.

For other categories, you may optionally provide additional context to help moderators review the report.

### Step 5: Submit the Report

Click the submit button to send your report to the moderation team. You'll see a confirmation message when your report has been successfully submitted.

## What Happens After You Report

### Immediate Actions

1. **Report Created**: Your report is immediately logged in the moderation system with a "pending" status
2. **Priority Assignment**: The system automatically assigns a priority level (P1-P5) based on the severity of the violation
3. **Confirmation**: You receive a confirmation message that your report was submitted

### Moderation Review Process

1. **Queue Placement**: Your report enters the moderation queue, sorted by priority and submission time
2. **Moderator Review**: A moderator reviews the reported content and your description
3. **Action Decision**: The moderator decides on the appropriate action based on community guidelines
4. **Resolution**: The report is marked as "resolved" or "dismissed"

### Possible Outcomes

Depending on the violation, moderators may take the following actions:

- **Content Removal**: The content is permanently deleted from the platform
- **Content Hidden**: The content is temporarily hidden while under review
- **User Warning**: The content creator receives a warning about the violation
- **User Suspension**: The user account is temporarily suspended (1, 7, or 30 days)
- **User Restrictions**: Specific restrictions are applied (posting, commenting, or uploading disabled)
- **User Ban**: In severe cases, the user account is permanently banned (admin action only)
- **Report Dismissed**: If the content doesn't violate guidelines, the report is dismissed

### Notification to Content Owner

When action is taken on reported content:

- The content owner receives a notification explaining the action and reason
- The notification includes information about the specific violation
- For suspensions or restrictions, the duration is clearly stated
- Information about appeal options is included (when available)

## Report Rate Limits

To prevent abuse of the reporting system:

- **Limit**: You can submit up to **10 reports per 24 hours**
- **Purpose**: This prevents spam reporting and ensures genuine reports are prioritized
- **Error Message**: If you exceed this limit, you'll see an error message and won't be able to submit additional reports until the 24-hour period expires

## Privacy and Anonymity

### Your Privacy

- Your identity as a reporter is kept confidential from the reported user
- Only moderators and admins can see who submitted a report
- Reports are logged for accountability and to prevent abuse

### What Moderators See

Moderators can view:

- The reported content and its context
- Your report reason and description
- Your user ID (for accountability)
- The timestamp of your report

## Best Practices for Reporting

### Do:

✅ **Report genuine violations**: Only report content that actually violates community guidelines

✅ **Choose the correct category**: Select the most appropriate reason for your report

✅ **Provide context**: When selecting "Other," provide clear details about the violation

✅ **Be specific**: Explain exactly what aspect of the content violates guidelines

✅ **Report once**: Submit one report per violation; duplicate reports don't speed up the process

### Don't:

❌ **Report content you simply disagree with**: Differences of opinion are not violations

❌ **Abuse the reporting system**: False or malicious reports may result in action against your account

❌ **Spam reports**: Submitting multiple reports for the same content doesn't help

❌ **Use reports for personal disputes**: Reports should be about guideline violations, not personal conflicts

❌ **Expect immediate action**: Moderators need time to review reports thoroughly
