## Fix #1: Rapid Track Navigation Race Condition

**Date:** January 25, 2025  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Problem
- Rapidly clicking next/previous buttons caused AbortError
- Playback would fail and stop
- Race condition when multiple navigation requests overlapped

### Solution
1. **AudioManager Improvements:**
   - Added state tracking for pending play operations
   - Enhanced `loadTrack()` to wait for pending operations
   - Enhanced `play()` to wait for loading to complete
   - Added proper error filtering for AbortErrors

2. **PlaybackContext Debouncing:**
   - Added 500ms debounce to next/previous functions
   - Prevents rapid-fire navigation
   - Uses refs to track navigation state

### Files Modified
- `client/src/lib/audio/AudioManager.ts`
- `client/src/contexts/PlaybackContext.tsx`

### Documentation
- [Detailed Fix Documentation](./fix-rapid-navigation-race-condition.md)

## Fix #2: UI Improvements

**Date:** January 25, 2025  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Problems Fixed
1. Mini player covering page content
2. Track display showing only description (missing username)
3. Mini player showing genre instead of username

### Solutions
1. **Bottom Padding:**
   - Added 80px bottom padding to body when mini player active
   - Prevents content from being hidden

2. **Track Display Username:**
   - Added username field to track display
   - Shows "by [username]" before description
   - Handles missing username gracefully

3. **Mini Player Username:**
   - Changed to show username instead of genre
   - More relevant information for users

### Files Modified
- `client/src/app/layout.tsx`
- `client/src/components/playlists/TrackReorderList.tsx`
- `client/src/components/playlists/MiniPlayer.tsx`

- Hover to show slider
- Persists to localStorage
- Restores on page load

### Implementation
- Volume slider component with hover interaction
- localStorage persistence
- Initial volume restoration
- Smooth volume transitions

### Files Modified
- `client/src/components/playlists/MiniPlayer.tsx`
- `client/src/contexts/PlaybackContext.tsx`

## Fix #4: Playlist Link Button

**Date:** January 25, 2025  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Feature Added

## Fix #5: State Restoration Errors

**Date:** January 25, 2025  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Problem
- Errors on page refresh when restoring playback state
- Invalid audio URLs causing failures
- State restoration not working reliably

### Solution
- Enhanced URL validation in restoration logic
- Use `getCachedAudioUrl()` consistently
- Better error handling for invalid states
- Graceful fallback when restoration fails

### Files Modified
- `client/src/contexts/PlaybackContext.tsx`

### Documentation
- [Detailed Fix Documentation](./fix-state-restoration-errors.md)

## Fix #6: Repeat Track Mode Not Working

**Date:** January 25, 2025  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Problem
- Repeat track mode not working
- Track would advance instead of repeating
- Event handler using stale state

### Solution
- Use refs for repeat mode in event handlers
- Store `repeatModeRef` that updates with state
- Event handler reads from ref for current value
- Prevents stale closure issues

### Files Modified
- `client/src/contexts/PlaybackContext.tsx`

### Documentation
- [Detailed Fix Documentation](./fix-repeat-track-and-end-behavior.md)

## Fix #7: Mini Player Closing After Final Track

**Date:** January 25, 2025  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Problem
- Mini player would close after final track
- User lost access to playback controls
- Had to restart playlist to see mini player

### Solution
- Pause instead of stop at playlist end
- Keep mini player visible
- Allow user to restart or navigate manually
- Only applies when repeat mode is off

### Files Modified
- `client/src/contexts/PlaybackContext.tsx`

### Documentation
- [Detailed Fix Documentation](./fix-repeat-track-and-end-behavior.md)

## Fix #8: Position Accuracy After Refresh

**Date:** January 25, 2025  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Problem
- Position not accurate after page refresh
- Could be off by several seconds
- State saved too infrequently

### Solution
- Added `beforeunload` event listener
- Saves state immediately before page unload
- Ensures most recent position captured
- Complements existing throttled saves

### Files Modified
- `client/src/contexts/PlaybackContext.tsx`

### Documentation
- [Detailed Fix Documentation](./fix-position-accuracy-and-volume-persistence.md)

## Fix #9: Volume Not Persisting

**Date:** January 25, 2025  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Problem
- Volume reset to 100% on page refresh
- User preferences not saved
- Had to adjust volume every session

### Solution
- Save volume to localStorage on change
- Restore volume on component mount
- Initialize AudioManager with saved volume
- Fallback to 100% if no saved value

### Files Modified
- `client/src/contexts/PlaybackContext.tsx`

### Documentation
- [Detailed Fix Documentation](./fix-position-accuracy-and-volume-persistence.md)

## Fix #10: Volume Changes Stopping Playback

**Date:** January 25, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Problem
- Changing volume stopped audio playback
- All controls became unresponsive
- Play/pause button didn't work
- Progress bar seeking didn't work
- Required page refresh to restore functionality

### Root Cause
- AudioManager initialization effect had `volume` in dependencies
- Every volume change destroyed and recreated AudioManager
- Active playback stopped
- State became inconsistent

### Solution
- Removed `volume` from effect dependencies
- Changed `[volume]` to `[]`
- AudioManager now created once on mount
- Volume changes handled through `setVolume()` callback only
- AudioManager instance persists for component lifetime

### Why This Works
1. AudioManager created once on mount
2. Volume changes update existing instance
3. No unnecessary destruction/recreation
4. Playback continues uninterrupted
5. All controls remain responsive

### Files Modified
- `client/src/contexts/PlaybackContext.tsx` (line 133)

### Documentation
- [Detailed Fix Documentation](./fix-volume-stopping-playback.md)

## Key Learnings

### Effect Dependencies
- Carefully consider what should trigger effect re-runs
- Don't include values "just to be safe"
- Use refs for values that shouldn't trigger re-runs
- Document why dependencies are (or aren't) included

### Race Conditions
- Debounce rapid user interactions
- Track operation state with refs
- Handle promise cancellation properly
- Filter expected errors (like AbortError)

### State Management
- Use refs for event handlers to avoid stale closures
- Separate initialization from updates
- Don't recreate instances unnecessarily
- Persist user preferences appropriately

### Error Handling
- Validate inputs before processing
- Provide graceful fallbacks
- Log errors appropriately
- Don't expose technical details to users

## Production Readiness

### Checklist
- ✅ All critical bugs fixed
- ✅ All high-priority bugs fixed
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ ESLint checks pass
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ⏳ Manual testing pending
- ⏳ Cross-browser testing pending
- ⏳ Performance validation pending

### Recommendation
**Status:** Ready for manual testing phase

All code-level issues have been resolved. The implementation is stable and type-safe. Manual testing is required to verify user experience and catch any edge cases not covered by code review.
