# Fix: State Restoration Error on Page Refresh

**Date:** January 25, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

## Issue Description

**Reported Errors:**
```
Audio playback error
Failed to load track: Event
Failed to restore playback state: Event
Failed to play audio: NotSupportedError: The element has no supported sources.
Failed to resume playback: NotSupportedError: The element has no supported sources.
```

**Symptoms:**
- When mini player is open and page is refreshed, NextJS errors appear
- Audio element has no supported sources
- Playback state restoration fails
- User cannot resume playback after refresh

**Root Cause:**
When restoring playback state from sessionStorage after a page refresh:
1. The `track.file_url` field might be undefined/null in the restored track object
2. The code wasn't using `getCachedAudioUrl()` like the play functions do
3. Empty string was being passed to `loadTrack()`, causing "no supported sources" error

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced State Restoration

**File:** `client/src/contexts/PlaybackContext.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Load the track and seek to the stored position
if (audioManagerRef.current) {
  await audioManagerRef.current.loadTrack(track.file_url || '');
  
  // Seek to the stored position if it's valid
  if (restored.position > 0) {
    audioManagerRef.current.seek(restored.position);
  }
  
  // Don't auto-play on restoration, just restore the state
  // User can manually resume playback if desired
  setIsPlaying(false);
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Load the track and seek to the stored position
if (audioManagerRef.current) {
  // Get the audio URL (try multiple field names for compatibility)
  const audioUrl = track.file_url || track.audio_url;
  
  if (audioUrl) {
    // Use cached audio URL
    const cachedUrl = await getCachedAudioUrl(audioUrl);
    await audioManagerRef.current.loadTrack(cachedUrl);
    
    // Seek to the stored position if it's valid
    if (restored.position > 0) {
      audioManagerRef.current.seek(restored.position);
    }
  } else {
    console.warn('No audio URL found for track, clearing state');
    clearPlaybackState();
    return;
  }
  
  // Don't auto-play on restoration, just restore the state
  // User can manually resume playback if desired
  setIsPlaying(false);
}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **URL Validation**
   - Check if audio URL exists before attempting to load
   - Try both `file_url` and `audio_url` fields for compatibility
   - Clear state if no valid URL is found

2. **Consistent URL Processing**
   - Use `getCachedAudioUrl()` just like the play functions
   - Ensures proper URL transformation and caching
   - Prevents "no supported sources" error

3. **Better Error Handling**
   - Gracefully handle missing audio URLs
   - Clear stale state instead of leaving broken state
   - Provide clear console warnings for debugging

## Error Prevention

The fix prevents these scenarios:
- ❌ Loading track with empty string URL
- ❌ Loading track with undefined/null URL
- ❌ Inconsistent URL processing between play and restore
- ❌ Broken state persisting after failed restoration

## Testing Checklist

- [x] TypeScript compilation passes (0 errors)
- [ ] Manual test: Play a track, refresh page → no errors
- [ ] Manual test: Mini player state persists after refresh
- [ ] Manual test: Can resume playback after refresh
- [ ] Manual test: Seek position is restored correctly
- [ ] Manual test: Shuffle/repeat modes are restored

## Related Issues

This fix complements:
- [Rapid Navigation Race Condition Fix](./fix-rapid-navigation-race-condition.md) - Both ensure robust audio loading
- [UI Improvements](./ui-improvements.md) - Ensures restored tracks have proper data

## Files Modified

1. **`client/src/contexts/PlaybackContext.tsx`** - Enhanced state restoration logic

## Verification

```bash
✅ npm run type-check  # 0 errors
✅ Build successful
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

**On Page Refresh with Active Playback:**
1. ✅ Playback state is restored from sessionStorage
2. ✅ Track is loaded with valid audio URL
3. ✅ Seek position is restored
4. ✅ Playback is paused (user can manually resume)
5. ✅ No console errors
6. ✅ Mini player displays correct track info

**If State Cannot Be Restored:**
1. ✅ State is cleared gracefully
2. ✅ Warning logged to console
3. ✅ Mini player closes
4. ✅ No errors thrown
