# Test 4.3 Complete Fix Summary

## All Issues Resolved

Three issues were discovered and fixed during Test 4.3 (Track Reordering):

### Issue 1: Missing Database Function ✅ FIXED
**Error:** 404 on `/rest/v1/rpc/reorder_playlist_tracks`  
**Fix:** Applied function directly to remote database via Supabase MCP

### Issue 2: Frontend Null Reference ✅ FIXED
**Error:** `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'classList')`  
**Fix:** Stored element reference before setTimeout to prevent null access

### Issue 3: Schema Mismatch ✅ FIXED
**Error:** `column "updated_at" of relation "playlist_tracks" does not exist`  
**Fix:** Removed `updated_at = NOW()` from UPDATE statement (column doesn't exist)

## Current Function Definition

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION reorder_playlist_tracks(
  p_playlist_id UUID,
  p_track_positions JSONB
)
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
DECLARE
  track_update JSONB;
  v_user_id UUID;
  v_playlist_owner UUID;
BEGIN
  v_user_id := auth.uid();
  
  IF v_user_id IS NULL THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Not authenticated';
  END IF;
  
  SELECT user_id INTO v_playlist_owner
  FROM playlists
  WHERE id = p_playlist_id;
  
  IF v_playlist_owner IS NULL THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Playlist not found';
  END IF;
  
  IF v_playlist_owner != v_user_id THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Not authorized to reorder tracks in this playlist';
  END IF;
  
  -- Update each track position
  FOR track_update IN SELECT * FROM jsonb_array_elements(p_track_positions)
  LOOP
    UPDATE playlist_tracks
    SET position = (track_update->>'position')::INTEGER
    WHERE playlist_id = p_playlist_id
      AND track_id = (track_update->>'track_id')::UUID;
  END LOOP;
  
END;
$$;
```

## Verification

✅ Function exists in database  
✅ Function has correct signature  
✅ Function matches table schema  
✅ Frontend code fixed  
✅ No TypeScript errors  

## Ready for Testing

**Test 4.3 is now ready to retry.** All known issues have been resolved.

### Expected Behavior:
1. Drag a track by the handle (⋮⋮ icon)
2. Drop it at a new position
3. Track moves immediately (optimistic update)
4. "Reordering tracks..." overlay appears briefly
5. Track order persists after page refresh
6. No errors in console
7. Network request succeeds (204 No Content)
