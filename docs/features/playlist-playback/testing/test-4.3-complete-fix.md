# Test 4.3 Complete Fix Summary

## All Issues Resolved

Three issues were discovered and fixed during Test 4.3 (Track Reordering):

### Issue 1: Missing Database Function ✅ FIXED
**Error:** 404 on `/rest/v1/rpc/reorder_playlist_tracks`  
**Fix:** Applied function directly to remote database via Supabase MCP

### Issue 2: Frontend Null Reference ✅ FIXED
**Error:** `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'classList')`  
**Fix:** Stored element reference before setTimeout to prevent null access

### Issue 3: Schema Mismatch ✅ FIXED
**Error:** `column "updated_at" of relation "playlist_tracks" does not exist`  
**Fix:** Removed `updated_at = NOW()` from UPDATE statement (column doesn't exist)

## Current Function Definition

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION reorder_playlist_tracks(
  p_playlist_id UUID,
  p_track_positions JSONB
)
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
DECLARE
  track_update JSONB;
  v_user_id UUID;
  v_playlist_owner UUID;
BEGIN
  v_user_id := auth.uid();
  
  IF v_user_id IS NULL THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Not authenticated';
  END IF;
  
  SELECT user_id INTO v_playlist_owner
  FROM playlists
  WHERE id = p_playlist_id;
  
  IF v_playlist_owner IS NULL THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Playlist not found';
  END IF;
  
  IF v_playlist_owner != v_user_id THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Not authorized to reorder tracks in this playlist';
  END IF;
  
  -- Update each track position
  FOR track_update IN SELECT * FROM jsonb_array_elements(p_track_positions)
  LOOP
    UPDATE playlist_tracks
    SET position = (track_update->>'position')::INTEGER
    WHERE playlist_id = p_playlist_id
      AND track_id = (track_update->>'track_id')::UUID;
  END LOOP;
  
END;
$$;
```

## Verification

✅ Function exists in database  
✅ Function has correct signature  
✅ Function matches table schema  
✅ Frontend code fixed  
✅ No TypeScript errors  

## Additional Fix Applied (October 25, 2025)

### Issue 4: Missing Artist Names After Reorder ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** After reordering tracks, the username labels disappeared (they returned after page refresh).

**Root Cause:** The `getPlaylistWithTracks` function was only fetching data from the `tracks` table, which doesn't have an `artist_name` column. The artist name comes from joining with `user_profiles.username`. The server-side page component was doing this join manually, but the client-side refresh after reorder wasn't.

**Solution:** Updated `getPlaylistWithTracks` to:
1. Extract unique user IDs from the fetched tracks
2. Fetch corresponding usernames from `user_profiles` table
3. Add `artist_name` property to each track by matching user_id

**Code Change in `client/src/lib/playlists.ts`:**
```typescript
// Fetch user profiles for artist names
const userIds = [...new Set(sortedTracks.map((pt: any) => pt.track?.user_id).filter(Boolean))];
let profiles: Array<{ user_id: string; username: string }> = [];

if (userIds.length > 0) {
  const { data: profilesData } = await supabase
    .from('user_profiles')
    .select('user_id, username')
    .in('user_id', userIds);
  
  profiles = (profilesData as Array<{ user_id: string; username: string }>) || [];
}

// Add artist_name to each track
const tracksWithArtistNames = sortedTracks.map((pt: any) => {
  const profile = profiles.find((prof) => prof.user_id === pt.track?.user_id);
  return {
    ...pt,
    track: {
      ...pt.track,
      artist_name: profile?.username || 'Unknown Artist',
    },
  };
});
```

**Result:** Artist names now persist after reordering, matching the initial page load behavior.

## Ready for Testing

**Test 4.3 is now ready to retry.** All known issues have been resolved.

### Expected Behavior:
1. Drag a track by the handle (⋮⋮ icon)
2. Drop it at a new position
3. Track moves immediately (optimistic update)
4. "Reordering tracks..." overlay appears briefly
5. Track order persists after page refresh
6. No errors in console
7. Network request succeeds (204 No Content)
