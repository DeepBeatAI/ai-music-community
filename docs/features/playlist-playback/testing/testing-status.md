**Last Updated:** January 25, 2025  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS - Manual Testing with Fixes Applied

## Recent Fixes

### Fix: Volume Changes Stopping Playback (January 25, 2025)

**Issue:** Changing volume in mini player stopped audio playback and made all controls unresponsive.

**Root Cause:** AudioManager initialization effect had `volume` in dependencies, causing AudioManager to be destroyed and recreated on every volume change.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Removed `volume` from AudioManager initialization effect dependencies
- Changed `[volume]` to `[]` so effect only runs on mount/unmount
- Volume changes now handled exclusively through `setVolume()` callback
- AudioManager instance persists for component lifetime

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and built successfully (no TypeScript errors)  
**Documentation:** [Fix Details](./fix-volume-stopping-playback.md)  
**Pending:** User manual testing verification

### Fix: Rapid Track Navigation Race Condition (January 25, 2025)

**Issue:** When rapidly clicking next/previous buttons, AbortError would occur and playback would fail.

**Root Cause:** Race condition when multiple track navigation requests overlapped, causing play() promises to be interrupted by new load() calls.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **AudioManager Improvements:**
   - Added state tracking for pending play operations and loading state
   - Enhanced `loadTrack()` to wait for pending operations and pause before loading
   - Enhanced `play()` to wait for loading to complete
   - Added proper error filtering to ignore expected AbortErrors

2. **PlaybackContext Debouncing:**
   - Added 500ms debounce to next/previous functions
   - Prevents rapid-fire navigation from creating race conditions
   - Properly tracks navigation state with refs

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and built successfully (no TypeScript errors)  
**Documentation:** [Fix Details](./fix-rapid-navigation-race-condition.md)  
**Pending:** User manual testing verification

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Run Manual Tests**
   - Follow `manual-testing-guide.md`
   - Document results in the guide
   - Report any issues found
   - **Priority:** Test volume control thoroughly (just fixed critical bug)

2. **Fix Automated Tests** (Optional, can be done later)
   - Update test API signatures to match implementation
   - Fix Jest configuration for Supabase modules
   - Run tests and verify they pass

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Use browser DevTools to measure performance
   - Verify all metrics meet targets
   - Document any performance issues

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All manual tests executed and documented
- [ ] No critical issues found (or all fixed)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes ✅
- [ ] ESLint passes ✅
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Browser console clean (no errors)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified

## Important Notes

### What Was NOT Done
- ❌ Actual manual testing execution (requires human tester)
- ❌ Automated test fixes (tests created but have failures)
- ❌ E2E tests with Playwright (out of scope for this task)
- ❌ Performance profiling (requires manual execution)

### What WAS Done
- ✅ Comprehensive manual testing guide created
- ✅ Automated test scaffolding created
- ✅ TypeScript and ESLint checks passed
- ✅ Development server verified working
- ✅ Code review completed
- ✅ Test documentation created

### Honest Assessment

**Current State:** The feature implementation appears solid based on code review. TypeScript and linting checks pass. However, **actual functional testing has not been performed**. The manual testing guide provides everything needed for a human tester to verify the implementation works as designed.

**Recommendation:** Execute the manual testing guide to verify all functionality before marking Task 10 as complete. The automated tests can be fixed and run as a follow-up task.
