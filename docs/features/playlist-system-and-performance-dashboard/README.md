### Performance Dashboard

The performance dashboard consolidates scattered monitoring components into a unified interface for tracking application metrics, cache efficiency, and bandwidth usage.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Track session duration and cache hit rate
- Monitor component renders and effect executions
- Display cache statistics (metadata, images, audio)
- Show bandwidth usage and savings
- Auto-refresh metrics every 5 seconds
- Generate performance reports
- Clear cache data

**Tabs:**
- **Overview** - Session metrics and cache hit rate

- Cascade delete for referential integrity

**Indexes:**
- `playlists_user_id_idx` - Fast user playlist lookups
- `playlists_created_at_idx` - Chronological sorting
- `playlist_tracks_playlist_id_idx` - Fast playlist track lookups
- `playlist_tracks_track_id_idx` - Fast track-to-playlist lookups
- `playlist_tracks_position_idx` - Position-based sorting

### Type Definitions

**Location:** `client/src/types/playlist.ts`

**Key Types:**
- `Playlist` - Base playlist type
- `PlaylistInsert` - Playlist creation type
- `PlaylistUpdate` - Playlist update type
- `PlaylistTrack` - Playlist track junction type
- `PlaylistWithTracks` - Extended type with nested tracks
- `PlaylistFormData` - Form data interface
- `CreatePlaylistResponse` - API response type
- `PlaylistOperationResponse` - Operation result type

### Utility Functions

**Location:** `client/src/lib/playlists.ts`

**Functions:**
- `createPlaylist()` - Create new playlist
- `getUserPlaylists()` - Fetch user's playlists
- `getPlaylistWithTracks()` - Fetch playlist with tracks
- `updatePlaylist()` - Update playlist metadata
- `deletePlaylist()` - Delete playlist
- `addTrackToPlaylist()` - Add track to playlist

## Usage

### Creating a Playlist

```typescript
import { createPlaylist } from '@/lib/playlists';

const result = await createPlaylist(userId, {
  name: 'My Playlist',
  description: 'A collection of my favorite tracks',
  is_public: false
});

if (result.success) {
  console.log('Playlist created:', result.playlist);
} else {
  console.error('Error:', result.error);
}
```

### Adding a Track to Playlist

```typescript
import { addTrackToPlaylist } from '@/lib/playlists';

const result = await addTrackToPlaylist({
  playlist_id: 'playlist-uuid',
  track_id: 'track-uuid'
});

if (result.success) {
  console.log('Track added successfully');
} else {
  console.error('Error:', result.error);
}
```

### Using the Performance Dashboard

The dashboard is automatically available on all pages:

1. Click the dashboard button in the bottom-right corner
2. Dashboard expands to show tabs
3. Click tabs to view different metrics
4. Toggle auto-refresh to update metrics every 5 seconds
5. Click "Generate Report" to log metrics to console
6. Click "Clear" buttons to clear cache data
7. Click close button to collapse dashboard
