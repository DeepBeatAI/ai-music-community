## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Automated Verification Script Created

**File:** `client/verify-consistency.js`

A comprehensive Node.js script was created to automatically verify data consistency across pages. The script:
- Fetches trending tracks and popular creators from the database
- Compares results across different page limits
- Identifies any inconsistencies
- Provides detailed pass/fail reporting

**Usage:**
```bash
cd client
node verify-consistency.js
```

**Results:** ✅ ALL CONSISTENCY CHECKS PASSED

### 2. Manual Testing Checklist Created

**File:** `docs/features/popularity-alignment/testing/test-cross-page-consistency.md`

A comprehensive manual testing checklist was created covering:
- Step-by-step verification procedures
- Data consistency checks
- Section naming verification
- Edge case testing
- Browser compatibility testing
- Performance verification
- Issue reporting templates

### 3. Data Consistency Verified

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED

All three subtasks confirmed:

#### Task 4.1: Trending Tracks Consistency
- ✅ Home page shows 4 trending tracks
- ✅ Discover page shows 8 trending tracks
- ✅ Analytics page shows trending tracks
- ✅ First 4 tracks are identical across all pages
- ✅ Track order is consistent
- ✅ 7-day time window is consistent
- ✅ Scoring formula `(play_count × 0.7) + (like_count × 0.3)` is consistent

#### Task 4.2: Popular Creators Consistency
- ✅ Home page shows 3 popular creators
- ✅ Discover page shows 6 popular creators
- ✅ Analytics page shows popular creators
- ✅ First 3 creators are identical across all pages
- ✅ Creator order is consistent
- ✅ 7-day time window is consistent
- ✅ Scoring formula `(total_plays × 0.6) + (total_likes × 0.4)` is consistent

#### Task 4.3: Section Naming Consistency
- ✅ "Trending This Week" on all pages
- ✅ "Popular Creators" on Home and Discover
- ✅ "Suggested for You" on Home and Discover
- ✅ Analytics uses appropriate labels

### 4. Section Naming Issues Fixed

**Issues Found and Corrected:**

#### Issue 1: Home Page Trending Section
- **Before:** "🔥 Trending Tracks This Week"
- **After:** "🔥 Trending This Week"
- **File:** `client/src/components/AuthenticatedHome.tsx`
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED

#### Issue 2: Home Page Popular Creators Section
- **Before:** "⭐ Popular Creators This Week"
- **After:** "⭐ Popular Creators"
- **File:** `client/src/components/AuthenticatedHome.tsx`
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED
