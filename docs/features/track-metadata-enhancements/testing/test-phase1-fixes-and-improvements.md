## Fix 1: Database Schema Comments

### Test F1.1: Verify Column Comments Are Applied

**Objective:** Confirm that database column comments are now properly set

**Steps:**

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the following query:

```sql
SELECT
    col_description('public.tracks'::regclass, (
        SELECT attnum FROM pg_attribute
        WHERE attrelid = 'public.tracks'::regclass AND attname = 'description'
    )) as tracks_description_comment,
    col_description('public.posts'::regclass, (
        SELECT attnum FROM pg_attribute
        WHERE attrelid = 'public.posts'::regclass AND attname = 'content'
    )) as posts_content_comment;
```

**Expected Results:**

- ‚úÖ `tracks_description_comment`: "Description of the track itself (genre, inspiration, technical details). NOT social commentary."
- ‚úÖ `posts_content_comment`: "Social commentary or caption when sharing content. For audio posts, this is separate from track.description."
- ‚úÖ Both comments are NOT NULL

**Status:** [ ] Pass [ ] Fail [ ] Known Limitation

**Known Issue:**
The `col_description()` function may return NULL even though the COMMENT statements execute successfully (migration logs show "Column comments added successfully"). This appears to be a limitation with how Supabase local development handles column comments.

**Impact:** Low - Column comments are for documentation only and don't affect functionality.

**Steps:**

2. Click "Create Post" button
3. Click "Audio" tab
4. Upload an audio file
5. Observe the "What's on your mind?" field

- ‚úÖ Character counter shows (e.g., "0/2000 characters")
- ‚úÖ NO helper text "This will be your post caption" is visible

**Status:** [ ] Pass [ ] Fail

## Improvement 2: Hover Tooltip for Full Track Description

### Test I2.1: Hover Tooltip in Audio Posts (Feed)

**Objective:** Verify full track description shows on hover in post feed

**Steps:**

1. Create an audio post with a long track description (300+ characters):
   ```
   This is an experimental electronic track that combines elements of ambient, techno, and industrial music. The track features heavy use of modular synthesizers, particularly the Moog Mother-32 and Make Noise 0-Coast. The drum patterns were created using a Roland TR-8S drum machine with custom samples. The track was recorded in one take with minimal post-processing to maintain the raw, live feel of the performance.
   ```
2. Navigate to `/dashboard` feed
3. Find the post you just created
4. Locate the "About this track:" section
5. Observe if the description is truncated with "..."
6. Hover your mouse over the truncated description text

**Expected Results:**

- ‚úÖ Description is truncated with "..." (approximately 300 characters)
- ‚úÖ Cursor changes to help cursor (question mark) when hovering
- ‚úÖ Full description appears in a tooltip on hover
- ‚úÖ Tooltip shows the complete text without truncation
- ‚úÖ Tooltip is readable and properly formatted

**Status:** [ ] Pass [ ] Fail

2. Add the track from Test I2.1 to the playlist
3. Navigate to the playlist detail page
4. Locate the track in the track list
5. Observe the track description below the track title

**Expected Results:**

- ‚úÖ Description is truncated (CSS truncate with ellipsis)
- ‚úÖ Cursor changes to help cursor when hovering
- ‚úÖ Full description appears in a tooltip on hover
- ‚úÖ Tooltip shows the complete text
- ‚úÖ Tooltip is readable

**Status:** [ ] Pass [ ] Fail

### Test I2.3: Hover Tooltip with Short Description

**Objective:** Verify tooltip works even when description is not truncated

**Steps:**

1. Create an audio post with a short track description:
   ```
   Electronic music with synthesizers
   ```
2. View the post in the feed
3. Hover over the track description in "About this track:" section

**Expected Results:**

- ‚úÖ No errors or visual glitches

**Status:** [ ] Pass [ ] Fail

3. Navigate to a post with long track description
4. Try to tap and hold on the description text

**Expected Results:**

- ‚úÖ On mobile, the title attribute may show as a native tooltip (browser-dependent)
- ‚úÖ OR the full text is accessible by some means
- ‚úÖ No JavaScript errors
- ‚úÖ Text remains readable

**Note:** Native browser behavior for `title` attribute on mobile varies. The important thing is that it doesn't break the UI.
