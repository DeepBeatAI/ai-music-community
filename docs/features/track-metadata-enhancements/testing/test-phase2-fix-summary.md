# Phase 2 Database Fix Summary

**Date:** January 28, 2025  
**Issue:** Track upload failing with "Could not find the 'author' column of 'tracks' in the schema cache"  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Problem

When attempting to upload tracks after implementing Phase 2 (Track Author Field), the application returned an error:

```
PGRST204: Could not find the 'author' column of 'tracks' in the schema cache
```

This occurred because:
1. The migration file existed locally but was never applied to the **remote** Supabase database
2. The application was configured to use the remote database (not local)
3. PostgREST's schema cache didn't recognize the new column

---

## Root Cause

The migration `20250127000001_add_track_author_field.sql` was created but not successfully pushed to the remote database. The initial migration attempt referenced a `profiles` table that doesn't exist in the remote database schema.

---

## Solution Applied

### Step 1: Simplified Migration

Created a simplified version of the migration that doesn't depend on the `profiles` table:

```sql
-- Add author column
ALTER TABLE tracks ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS author TEXT;

-- Backfill with placeholder
UPDATE tracks SET author = 'Unknown Artist' WHERE author IS NULL;

-- Make mandatory
ALTER TABLE tracks ALTER COLUMN author SET NOT NULL;

-- Add constraints
ALTER TABLE tracks ADD CONSTRAINT track_author_not_empty CHECK (length(trim(author)) > 0);
ALTER TABLE tracks ADD CONSTRAINT track_author_max_length CHECK (length(author) <= 100);

-- Add index
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tracks_author ON tracks(author);

-- Create immutability trigger
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION prevent_author_update() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF OLD.author IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.author THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Track author cannot be modified after creation';
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER prevent_track_author_update
BEFORE UPDATE ON tracks
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION prevent_author_update();

-- Reload schema cache
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
```

### Step 2: Applied via SQL Editor

The migration was applied directly through the Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor (not via CLI) to ensure it reached the remote database.

### Step 3: Verified Schema Cache Reload

Confirmed the schema cache was reloaded and the `author` column is now recognized by PostgREST.

---

## Current State

✅ **Author column exists** in remote `tracks` table  
✅ **All existing tracks** have author set to "Unknown Artist"  
✅ **New tracks** require author field (mandatory)  
✅ **Author field is immutable** (cannot be changed after creation)  
✅ **Constraints active**: 1-100 characters, not empty  
✅ **Trigger active**: Prevents author updates  
✅ **Schema cache refreshed**: PostgREST recognizes the column  

---

## Testing Status

- ✅ Track upload works with author field
- ✅ Author field is pre-filled with username
- ✅ Custom author names work
- ✅ Database constraints enforced
- ⏳ Full Phase 2 testing in progress (Task 2.10)

---

## Important Notes

### Remote vs Local Database

**Your setup uses the REMOTE Supabase database**, not local:
- `.env.local` points to: `https://trsctwpczzgwbbnrkuyg.supabase.co`
- All migrations must be applied to the remote database
- Local Supabase instance is NOT running and NOT needed

### Testing Documentation Updated

The testing guide has been updated to reflect remote database usage:
- Changed references from `localhost:54323` to Supabase Dashboard
- Removed requirement for local Supabase instance
- Updated all database verification steps

### Existing Tracks

All tracks created before this migration have `author = "Unknown Artist"`. You can optionally update these manually via SQL if needed:

```sql
UPDATE tracks 
SET author = 'Your Actual Artist Name'
WHERE id = 'track-id-here';
```

**Note:** This will fail due to the immutability trigger. To update existing tracks, you would need to temporarily disable the trigger, update, then re-enable it.

## Files Modified

1. `docs/features/track-metadata-enhancements/testing/test-phase2-manual-testing-guide.md`
   - Updated prerequisites (removed local Supabase requirement)
   - Changed all Supabase Studio references to Dashboard
   - Updated URLs from localhost to remote dashboard

2. Remote Database (via SQL Editor)
   - Applied author column migration
   - Created immutability trigger
   - Reloaded schema cache

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Continue with Phase 2 manual testing (Task 2.10)
2. Test author display in various contexts (posts, playlists, search)
3. Verify immutability trigger works
4. Complete remaining Phase 2 tasks (2.5-2.9 display updates)

---

## Prevention for Future

To avoid this issue in the future:

1. **Always verify which database you're using** (local vs remote)
2. **Check `.env.local`** to confirm database URL
3. **Apply migrations directly via Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor** for remote databases
4. **Verify schema cache reload** after adding new columns
5. **Test immediately** after applying migrations

**Resolution Time:** ~15 minutes  
**Impact:** No data loss, all existing tracks preserved  
**Status:** Ready to continue testing ✅
