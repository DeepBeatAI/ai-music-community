## Quick Database Check

```sql
-- Run in Supabase Studio SQL Editor

-- 1. Check all tracks have authors
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_tracks, 
       COUNT(author) as tracks_with_author,
       COUNT(*) - COUNT(author) as missing_authors
FROM tracks;
-- Expected: missing_authors = 0

-- 2. Check author constraints
SELECT column_name, is_nullable, character_maximum_length
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'tracks' AND column_name = 'author';
-- Expected: is_nullable = 'NO', character_maximum_length = NULL (unlimited but constrained)

-- 3. Check trigger exists
SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, action_timing
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_name = 'prevent_track_author_update';
-- Expected: 1 row, event_manipulation = 'UPDATE', action_timing = 'BEFORE'

-- 4. Test trigger (should fail)
UPDATE tracks SET author = 'New Author' WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM tracks LIMIT 1);
-- Expected: ERROR: Track author cannot be modified after creation
```
