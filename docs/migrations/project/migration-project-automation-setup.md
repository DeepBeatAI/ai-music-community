# File Organization Automation - Setup Complete ✅

## Overview

Automated file organization system is now active! All non-code files will be automatically organized into the correct directories.

---

## What Was Created

### 1. Organization Scripts (2 files)

#### `scripts/utilities/organize-files.sh`
- Bash script for Unix/Linux/Mac
- Scans for misplaced files
- Moves them to correct locations
- Reports all changes

#### `scripts/utilities/organize-files.ps1`
- PowerShell script for Windows
- Same functionality as bash script
- Cross-platform compatibility

### 2. Git Hook (1 file)

#### `.husky/pre-commit`
- Runs automatically before each commit
- Checks for misplaced files
- Organizes them automatically
- Stages changes for commit

### 3. Documentation (1 file)

#### `docs/migrations/file-organization-automation.md`
- Complete documentation
- Usage instructions
- Customization guide
- Troubleshooting tips

### 4. NPM Scripts (added to package.json)

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "organize": "bash scripts/utilities/organize-files.sh",
    "organize:win": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/utilities/organize-files.ps1",
    "organize:check": "bash scripts/utilities/organize-files.sh --dry-run"
  }
}
```

---

## How It Works

### Automatic (Recommended)

**Before every commit:**
1. Git hook runs automatically
2. Scans for misplaced files
3. Moves them to correct locations
4. Stages changes
5. Commit proceeds

**You don't need to do anything!** ✨

### Manual

**Run anytime:**
```bash
# Unix/Linux/Mac
npm run organize

# Windows
npm run organize:win

# Check without moving (dry run)
npm run organize:check
```

## File Organization Rules

### Documentation Files (*.md)

| Location | Pattern | Destination |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Root | Contains "test" | `docs/testing/guides/` |
| Root | Contains "migration" | `docs/migrations/` |
| Root | Contains "security" | `docs/security/` |
| Root | Contains "task" | `docs/tasks/` |
| Root | Contains "review" | `docs/reviews/` |
| Root | Other | `docs/migrations/` |
| Client | Contains "test/verification" | `docs/testing/test-results/` |
| Client | Contains "guide" | `docs/testing/guides/` |
| Client | Contains "quality" | `docs/reviews/` |
| Client | Contains "task" | `docs/tasks/` |
| Client | Other | `docs/features/` |

### Test Files

| File Type | Destination |
|-----------|-------------|
| `*.html` | `tests/html/` |
| `*.report.html` | `tests/reports/` |
| Test `*.js` | `tests/scripts/` |

### Scripts

| Pattern | Destination |
|---------|-------------|
| Contains "test" | `scripts/testing/` |
| Contains "deploy/install" | `scripts/deployment/` |
| `*.sql` | `scripts/database/` |
| Other | `scripts/utilities/` |

---

## Protected Files

These files are **never moved**:

### Root
- `README.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `.gitignore`
- `.gitattributes`

### Client
- `README.md`
- `package.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `next.config.js`
- `jest.config.js`

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Creating a New Test Document

**Before:**
```bash
# Accidentally create in root
echo "# Test Results" > test-results.md
git add .
git commit -m "Add test results"
```

**What Happens:**
```
🔍 Checking for misplaced non-code files...
📦 Moving: test-results.md → docs/testing/guides/test-results.md
   Reason: Test documentation
✅ Organized 1 file(s)
```

**Result:** File automatically moved to correct location! ✅

### Example 2: Creating HTML Test File

**Before:**
```bash
# Create test file in client
touch client/my-test.html
git add .
git commit -m "Add test"
```

**What Happens:**
```
📦 Moving: client/my-test.html → tests/html/my-test.html
   Reason: HTML test file
✅ Organized 1 file(s)
```

**Result:** File automatically moved! ✅

### Example 3: Manual Organization

**Run manually:**
```bash
npm run organize
```

**Output:**
```
🔍 Checking for misplaced non-code files...
✅ All files are in the correct locations!
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Disable for One Commit

If you need to commit without running the hook:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Your message"
```

### Check Without Moving

See what would be moved without actually moving:
```bash
npm run organize:check
```

### Run on Specific Directory

Edit the script to target specific directories:
```bash
# In organize-files.sh
# Add custom directory check
```

---

## Customization

### Adding New Rules

Edit `scripts/utilities/organize-files.sh`:

```bash
# Example: Add API documentation rule
case "$filename" in
    *api*|*API*)
        move_file "$file" "docs/api/${filename,,}" "API documentation"
        ;;
esac
```

### Changing Destinations

Modify the destination paths:

```bash
# Change test results location
move_file "$file" "docs/testing/results/$filename" "Test result"
```

### Adding New File Types

Add new patterns to scan:

```bash
# Example: Organize PDF files
for file in *.pdf; do
    move_file "$file" "docs/pdfs/$file" "PDF documentation"
done
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Hook Not Running

**Problem:** Pre-commit hook doesn't execute

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reinstall husky
npm install
npx husky install

# Make hook executable
chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
```

### Script Errors

**Problem:** Script fails with errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check script syntax
bash -n scripts/utilities/organize-files.sh

# Run with verbose output
bash -x scripts/utilities/organize-files.sh
```

### Files Not Moving

**Problem:** Files detected but not moved

**Solution:**
- Check file permissions
- Ensure destination directories exist
- Run script manually to see errors

---

## Testing

### Test the Automation

1. **Create a test file:**
   ```bash
   echo "# Test" > test-doc.md
   ```

2. **Try to commit:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Test automation"
   ```

3. **Verify:**
   - File should be moved to `docs/testing/guides/`
   - Commit should include the moved file
   - Check with `git status`

---

## Maintenance

### Regular Reviews

**Monthly:**
- Review organization rules
- Check for new file types
- Update patterns as needed

**Quarterly:**
- Full audit of file organization
- Update documentation
- Team feedback session

### Updates

When adding new rules:
1. Update both `.sh` and `.ps1` scripts
2. Update documentation
3. Test with sample files
4. Notify team
