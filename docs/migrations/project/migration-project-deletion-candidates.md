## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Deletion (Low Risk) - 6 files
These files are safe to delete immediately:
```bash
# Backup files
rm tests/scripts/debug_dashboard_backup.js
rm tests/scripts/test_dashboard_query_backup.js

# Old reports
rm tests/reports/chromewebdata_2025-10-08_20-42-02.report.html
rm tests/reports/localhost_2025-10-08_20-43-50.report.html
rm tests/reports/lighthouse-report.html
rm tests/reports/eslint-report.json
```

### Review Before Deletion (Medium Risk) - 7 files

**Questions to ask yourself:**

1. **Deployment Scripts:**
   - Have all deployments been completed successfully?
   - Do you need to reference these for future deployments?
   - Are these documented elsewhere?

2. **Installation Scripts:**
   - Will you set up new development environments?
   - Are the installation steps documented elsewhere?
   - Can you recreate these if needed?

3. **Validation/Test Scripts:**
   - Do you need to re-run these validations?
   - Are the tests covered by automated test suites?
   - Can you recreate these if needed?

**If YES to any questions:** Keep the files  
**If NO to all questions:** Safe to delete

## Alternative: Archive Instead of Delete

If you're unsure, create an archive folder:

```bash
# Create archive folder
mkdir -p archive/old-scripts
mkdir -p archive/old-reports

# Move instead of delete
mv tests/reports/*.html archive/old-reports/
mv tests/reports/*.json archive/old-reports/
mv scripts/deployment/*.bat archive/old-scripts/
mv scripts/deployment/*.sh archive/old-scripts/
mv scripts/testing/*compression*.sh archive/old-scripts/
```

Then add to `.gitignore`:
```
archive/
```

This way, files are out of the way but still accessible locally if needed.

- **Total Candidates:** 13 files
- **Safe to Delete:** 6 files (backup files and old reports)
- **Review Needed:** 7 files (deployment and installation scripts)
