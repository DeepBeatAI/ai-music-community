## 📋 Next Steps

### Step 1: Review Deletion Candidates (5 minutes)
Open `DELETION_CANDIDATES.md` and review the 13 flagged files:
- 6 files are safe to delete immediately (backups and old reports)
- 7 files need your review (deployment scripts)

### Step 2: Delete or Archive (2 minutes)
Choose one:

**Option A: Delete safe files immediately**
```bash
rm tests/scripts/debug_dashboard_backup.js
rm tests/scripts/test_dashboard_query_backup.js
rm tests/reports/*.html
rm tests/reports/*.json
```

**Option B: Archive everything for safety**
```bash
mkdir -p archive
mv tests/scripts/debug_dashboard_backup.js archive/
mv tests/scripts/test_dashboard_query_backup.js archive/
mv tests/reports/*.html archive/
mv tests/reports/*.json archive/
```

### Step 3: Commit Changes (2 minutes)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Reorganize non-code files into clean structure

- Moved 58 files into organized directories
- Created docs/, tests/, and scripts/ subdirectories
- Grouped files by purpose (features, testing, security, etc.)
- Improved project organization and maintainability

See REORGANIZATION_COMPLETE.md for full details"
```

### Step 4: Update Documentation (Optional)
If any documentation references old file paths, update them.

### Step 5: Clean Up Planning Docs (Optional)
After committing, you can delete these planning documents:
```bash
rm REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md
rm REORGANIZATION_COMPLETE.md
rm REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md
rm DELETION_CANDIDATES.md
```

Or keep them for reference - your choice!
