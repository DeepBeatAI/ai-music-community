   - Performance testing across different dataset sizes

4. **Enhanced Filter Logic:**
   - Optimized `applyFiltersDirectly` function with performance tracking
   - Early return for no active filters
   - Performance warnings for slow filtering operations
   - Efficient handling of large datasets (>1000, >5000 posts)

**Performance Metrics:**
- ✅ Filtering performance tracked and logged
- ✅ Memory optimization for large datasets
- ✅ Performance warnings for operations >100ms
- ✅ Optimization strategies based on dataset size
- ✅ Performance grading and suggestions system

### Testing Coverage

#### Unit Tests ✅
- **Creator Filter Logic:** 20 tests covering all filtering scenarios
- **Creator Filter UI:** 24 tests covering component behavior and states
- **Performance Optimization:** Tests for different dataset sizes and edge cases

#### Integration Tests ✅
- **Complete User Flow:** 9 comprehensive integration tests
- **Performance Testing:** Large dataset handling and optimization verification
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of edge cases and errors
